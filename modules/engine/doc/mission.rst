mission
=======

Overview
--------

The mission application is the baseline executable for the WSF application.  It reads text files containing :ref:`WSF_REFERENCE_GUIDE` and executes the simulation, advancing through time, moving platforms, making decisions and performing interactions between objects.

Execution modes are as follows:

* Event-stepped or frame-stepped.
* Realtime or non-realtime (see :command:`realtime` or :command:`non-realtime`.)
* Purely constructive including multiple :ref:`Monte_Carlo_Iteration` s.
* As part of a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) exercise (see :command:`dis_interface`).

mission has three major forms of output:

* An event log controlled by the input command :command:`event_output`. This is a human-readable text file that can be
  visualized with the program **Timeview** or post-processed through any variety of scripting programs (e.g., Perl,
  Python). Another event log file capability is to use :command:`csv_event_output` to create a set of default comma-delimited (or
  user-specified delimiter) files.  It is also possible to create completely unique event output log information with the
  :command:`observer` command to trigger a user-defined script that writes information to either the screen or to a file.
* A binary event report file, that can be viewed with **Mystic Application**, controlled by the input command :command:`event_pipe`.
* **(May be deprecated in future)** A binary 'replay file' that can be visualized with **VESPA**. The replay file is produced by specifying
  the :command:`dis_interface.record` command within the :command:`dis_interface` block.

Command Line
------------

::

 mission [ -es | -rt | -fs | -fio | -sm | -mi <interval> | -log-server-host <hostname> | -log-server-port <portNumber> | -profiling-output <output-location> | -profiling-library <library-path>] <file-1> [ <file-2> ... <file-n> ]

Where:

**-es (Default)**
 Run the the event-stepped simulation executive

 **Note:** By default the event-stepped simulation executive will run in non-real-time mode (i.e., it will dispatch
 events as fast as possible). To run event-stepped and participate in a real-time DIS exercise, be sure to include the
 command :command:`realtime` in the input.

**-rt**
 Run the frame-stepped simulation executive in real-time mode (frame advance will occur in step with the wall clock).

 **Note:** At the current time, the use of this option is **NOT** recommended for anything other than the simplest of
 scenarios. The current frame-stepped executive does not deal with 'broken frames' very gracefully. Instead, please use
 the event-stepped simulation executive and specify the :command:`realtime` command in your
 input file (as described in the -es parameter above).

**-fs**
 Run the frame-stepped simulation executive in non-real-time mode {frame advance will occur when all work for a frame
 is completed).

 **Note:** This is equivalent to specifying **-rt** and including the command
 :command:`non-realtime` in the input.

**-fio**
 Each time the simulation is advanced, ensure that all characters are written from the standard output stream to their
 destination and that the buffer is cleared (flushed).

**-sm**
 Suppress the periodic messages indicating advance of the simulation time.

**-mi <interval>**
 Output periodic messages indicating advance of the simulation time at the given time interval (in seconds).

**-list-variables**
 Output the list of preprocessor variables used in the scenario files and quit.
 
**-log-server-host <host>**
 Tells mission which host to connect the log server client to.
 
**-log-server-port <port>**
 Tells mission which port to connect the log server client to.

**-profiling-output <output-location>**
 Place to which to write performance profiling output.
 Currently, the output location is a file path;
 we may offer other means of output in the future.
 File will be created if it does not yet exist.
 Profiling will only be enabled if this option is provided.

 **Note:** Performance profiling for C++ code is an early access feature preview.
 Both the "hooks" (C interfaces provided by the shared library)
 and the higher-level C++ interfaces for performance profiling are subject to change.
 The default library's output format will also change.

**-profiling-library <library-path>**
 Path of a nondefault shared library of performance profiling hooks.
 If not provided and if profiling is enabled,
 then the default profiling library will be used when profiling.

 **Note:** Performance profiling for C++ code is an early access feature preview.
 Both the "hooks" (C interfaces provided by the shared library)
 and the higher-level C++ interfaces for performance profiling are subject to change.
 The default library's output format will also change.

**<file-1> [ <file-2> ... <file-n> ]**
 One or more files that contain commands documented in the :ref:`WSF_REFERENCE_GUIDE`.
