Overview
========

   The WSF_BRAWLER_PROCESSOR "processor_type" is to be used for BRAWLER within-visual-range air-to-air combat maneuvering.  See
   the "brawler_demo" for several examples of it's use.  The WSF_BRAWLER_PROCESSOR uses a :model:`WSF_BRAWLER_MOVER`,
   :model:`WSF_PERCEPTION_PROCESSOR`, and a :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` with script behaviors that leverage the :class:`WsfBrawlerProcessor`
   evaluation and control functions.  The WSF_BRAWLER_PROCESSOR relies on receiving a "WEAPON" task to know who its target
   is for 1v1 aerial combat maneuvering; this is exampled in the demo.  See the :class:`WsfBrawlerProcessor` script object class for all
   supported mover and route commands.

Commands
========

.. command:: mind_file <file-name>

   Specify a BRAWLER mind file for modeling mind and consciousness event updating.  The MIND files in the BRAWLER unclassified
   release are 100% compatible.

   **Default** No File - default values used

.. command:: mover :model:`WSF_BRAWLER_MOVER` mover-commands ... end_mover

   Defines the BRAWLER mover to be used by the BRAWLER platform.

.. command:: debug

   If specified, debug information for every alternative evaluation will be printed to the standard output.

.. command:: draw_alternatives

   If specified, color coded dots of every forward-projected alternative will be rendered to the DIS replay file.
   Green means the alternative evaluated close to the maximum value seen so far, red means the opposite, yellow/orange is in between.

.. command:: draw_nominal_states

   If specified, color coded dots of my target's forward-projected nominal state will be rendered to the DIS replay file. Blue dots are mine and purple dots are my target.  BRAWLER nominal states projection is simply a physics based forward projection where acceleration is ignored and velocity in locked constant for the projection.  The nominal states are often used in the evaluation functions.

.. command:: time_allowed_per_sector_search <time-value>

   Supposed to represent that time allowed to search a sector of the sky.  Affects consciousness event timing.

   **Default** 10 seconds

.. command:: consciousness_event_update_time <time-value>

   Override BRAWLER consciousness event timing.  If specified, all consciousness events will occur at this interval.  Otherwise a
   dynamic timing calculation will regularly occur to determine proper consciousness event update times.

   **Default** not specified
