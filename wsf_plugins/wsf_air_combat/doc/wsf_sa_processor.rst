Overview
========

The Situation Awareness (SA) Processor is a critical component of AFSIM's cognitive model, providing perception, assessment/comprehension, and prediction/projection functions. The SA Processor is based on Endsley’s Model of Situational Awareness, and provides the means to perform the Observe and Orient (OO) components of the OODA loop, while :doc:`Advanced Behavior Trees<advanced_behavior_tree>` (ABTs) provide the means to perform the Decide and Act (DA) components of the OODA loop.

Perceived Items are the primary approach in the SA Processor for modeling cognitive load and limits. Perceived Items include both groups and entity perceptions.
Pilots utilize groups or clusters of threats/targets to reduce the number of items being perceived.
In some cases, rather than perceiving and remembering each item in a group, the pilot instead perceives and remembers the group. Hence, rather than perceiving a collection of four aircraft, the pilot instead perceives a single group, reducing the number of perceived items from 4 to 1. We call this an unfocused group perception, and it is a means to reduce the number of perceived items while still maintaining some SA.
However, in other cases, the pilot may want to have detailed perception of each item in a group, and in this case, the pilot may perceive that the items form a "conceptual" group, simply as a means of organization. We call this focused or detailed group perception, since it maintains the full details of the members of group and the pilot is focused on the members of the group. This type of group does not affect the number of perceived items.

There are two ways of looking at detailed groups: entity-centric, or group-centric. From an entity-centric perspective, a detailed group neither increases nor reduces the number of perceived items, and each of the entities it contains increase the number of perceived items by one. From a group-centric perspective, a detailed group increases the number of perceived items by the number of entities that it contains. Similarly, from an entity-centric perspective, detailed groups have no consideration score, but from a group-centric perspective, a detailed group's score is equivalent to that of its highest scoring member.

.. note:: Groups and cognitive limits are meant to be used for human pilots – synthetic pilots on autonomous vehicles typically do not use groups to reduce cognitive loads, since they often have rather large limits and do not need to reduce cognitive load in this manner.

Groups can be formed, disbanded, focused, or unfocused automatically by the SAP. However, many of its automatic functions can be overridden with custom scripts.

.. note:: The SA Processor replaces some functionality previously performed by the :model:`WSF_PERCEPTION_PROCESSOR`. Although a Perception Processor is allowed on a platform with an SA Processor, that is not the intended configuration and should be avoided, whenever possible.

The cognitive model is shown in the image below. Across the bottom, in red, is Boyd's OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) model. In AFSIM, the OODA loop is divided into two modules, displayed just above the OODA block. SA Processors, in blue, handle observation and orientation, and :doc:`Advanced Behavior Trees<advanced_behavior_tree>` (ABTs), in green, carry out decision and action.

  .. _sa_update_interval_commands:

Update Interval Commands
========================

The SA Processor has multiple responsibilities which can be carried out at different rates. These rates can be given initial values and can also be changed during the simulation through script.

Some of these only determine the rate at which data is sent through the event pipe. These have the suffix ``data_update_interval``. However, others determine the rate at which information is processed internally. These use the suffix ``calculation_update_interval``.

Updates can only happen when the processor itself (whose update rate is set by :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.update_interval`) updates. As a result, best practice is to make sure that the following update intervals are each multiples of :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.update_interval`.

.. warning:: All update interval settings in this section will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.update_interval` value. To prevent rounding to zero, a positive setting less than :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.update_interval`/2 will be rounded to :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.asset_perception`; however, a value of zero can be used to disable a specific update type.

.. command:: report_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting asset status data

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: engagement_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting engagement data (:ref:`msg_sa_engagement_summary_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: flight_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting flight data (:ref:`msg_sa_flight_kinematics_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: fuel_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting fuel data (:ref:`msg_sa_fuel_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: nav_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting navigational data (:ref:`msg_sa_nav_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: flight_controls_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting controls data (:ref:`msg_sa_flight_controls_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: weapons_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting weapons data (:ref:`msg_sa_weapons_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: track_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting track data (:ref:`msg_sa_track_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: asset_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting asset data (:ref:`msg_sa_asset_data` messages)

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no delayed interval, uses current truth or received asset messages; see :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.asset_perception`)

.. command:: asset_purge_lifetime <time-value>

   Specifies the maximum lifetime of assets that lack an update. Assets will be automatically purged if they have not been updated within the specified lifetime limit.

   **Default:** The default value depends on whether asset_update_interval has been specified. If so, the default purge lifetime is 2.5 times the asset_update_interval. If not, a default of 5 seconds is used.

.. command:: perceived_item_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting bogie, bandit, and group data (:ref:`msg_sa_threat_data` and :ref:`msg_sa_group_data` messages).

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)

.. command:: prioritized_item_data_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for reporting prioritized threat data (:ref:`msg_sa_prioritized_data` messages).

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data sent)
   
.. command:: perceived_item_calculation_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for calculating bogie, bandit, and group data.

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data calculated)

.. command:: prioritized_item_calculation_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the update interval for calculating prioritized threat data.

   **Default:** 0 seconds (no data calculated)

.. command:: behavior_calculation_update_interval <time-value>

   The SA Processor is unique in that the rate at which :class:`WsfAdvancedBehaviorTree`\s and :class:`WsfStateMachine`\s update can be optionally set separately from the processor's update rate. As a result, the default value of 0 means that it will update at the same rate as the processor, as opposed to never updating.

   **Default:** 0 seconds (updates whenever the processor itself updates)

   .. _sa_update_interval_groups:

Update Interval Group Commands
==============================

Some of the above interval commands can be set to a common value within pre-defined groups: cognitive_update_interval_, platform_update_interval_, and universal_update_interval_.

.. note:: Only data update intervals can be set this way. Calculation update intervals must be set individually.

.. command:: cognitive_update_interval <time-value>

   The following group of :ref:`sa_update_interval_commands` is set to a common value by this command:

      asset_data_update_interval_

      weapons_data_update_interval_

.. command:: universal_update_interval <time-value>

   All :ref:`sa_update_interval_commands` are set to a common value by this command (excludes asset_purge_lifetime_ and all calculation update interval commands).

Enemy/Friendly Types
====================

The :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` supports the use of multiple techniques to determine if a 
:class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` is perceived as a friend, foe, neutral, or unknown. The commands below allow perception based on the side of the platform, the type of platform, and whether IFF should be used. In addition, missile types can be specified and if the platform type is used for perception, it may also be perceived as a missile, rather than the default, which is an aircraft. A :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` may also be perceived as a missile if the platform is a category *missile*.

.. command:: enemy_side <string>

   Specifies the name(s) of the enemy's side(s). If a track has the same side identification as the `enemy_side`_, then the track is considered to be a bandit. Note that multiple entries allows multiple sides to be enemy.

.. command:: friendly_side <string>

   Specifies the name(s) of the friendly side(s). If a track has the same side identification as the `friendly_side`_, then the track is considered to be a friendly. Note that multiple entries allows multiple sides to be friendly. In addition, the same side of the platform containing the SA Processor is always considered friendly, even without specifying it in this manner.

.. command:: neutral_side <string>

   Specifies the name(s) of the neutral side(s). If a track has the same side identification as the `neutral_side`_, then the track is considered to be a neutral. Note that multiple entries allows multiple sides to be neutral.

.. command:: enemy_type <string>

   Adds the enemy type to the list of known enemy types. If a track has the same type identification as the `enemy_type`_, then the track is considered to be a bandit. Note that the type does not necessarily have to be a platform type, it may also be a sensor type, since some sensors will report a sensor type rather than a platform type.

.. command:: friendly_type <string>

   Adds the friendly type to the list of known friendly types. If a track has the same type identification as the `friendly_type`_, then the track is considered to be friendly. Note that the type does not necessarily have to be a platform type, it may also be a sensor type, since some sensors will report a sensor type rather than a platform type.

.. command:: neutral_type <string>

   Adds the neutral type to the list of known neutral types. If a track has the same type identification as the `neutral_type`_, then the track is considered to be neutral. Note that the type does not necessarily have to be a platform type, it may also be a sensor type, since some sensors will report a sensor type rather than a platform type.

.. command:: missile_type <string>

   Adds the missile type to the list of known missile types. If a track has the same type identification as the `missile_type`_, then the track is considered to be a missile. Note that the type does not necessarily have to be a platform type, it may also be a sensor type, since some sensors will report a sensor type rather than a platform type.

.. command:: asset_ignore <category-name>

   Adds the platform category to a list of assets that will be ignored on the :doc:`ACES Display<wkf_plugin/wk_aces_display>`.

.. command:: filter_assets_from_tracks <boolean-value>

   If true, assets/friendlies will be filtered from track lists

   **Default:** true

.. command:: use_iff_id <boolean-value>

   If true, includes the use of IFF in determining identification. When used, :command:`iff_mapping` must be defined.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: use_simple_id_by_type <boolean-value>

   If true, a simple identification-by-type approach will be used. In this case, rather than specifying list of enemy, friendly, and neutral types using `enemy_side`_, `friendly_side`_, and `neutral_side`_, a much simpler approach is used, where identification-by-type is performed merely if the track supports *type id*.

   **Default:** false

Missile Identification Filters
==============================

These commands provide a means to identify/classify tracks as missiles. Any track meeting these conditions will be considered to be a missile.

In addition, using the missile types defined in `Enemy/Friendly Types`_ allows the entity to be perceived as a missile, rather than the default, which is an aircraft. A :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` may also be perceived as a missile if the platform is a category **missile**.


.. command:: missile_speed_any_alt <speed-value>

   If the speed of the track is greater than the specified speed and at any altitude, it will be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft).

.. command:: missile_alt_any_speed <length-value>

   If the altitude of the track is greater than the specified altitude and at any speed, it will be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft).

.. command:: missile_speed_with_alt <speed-value>

   If the speed of the track is greater than the specified speed at (or greater than) the altitude specified in `missile_alt_with_speed`_, it will be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft).

.. command:: missile_alt_with_speed <length-value>

   If the altitude of the track is greater than the specified altitude at (or greater than) the speed specified in `missile_speed_with_alt`_, it will be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft).

These commands provide a means to filter-out tracks from consideration as missiles. Any track meeting these conditions will not be considered to be a missile (they will be filtered-out).

.. command:: missile_nose_angle <angle-value>

   If the ownship lies outside of the specified angle off the nose of the track, it will not be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft). This allows filtering-out tracks that are not heading towards the ownship.

.. command:: missile_time_to_intercept <time-value>

   If the time to intercept of the track is greater than than the specified time, it will not be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft). This allows filtering-out tracks that will not intercept the ownship within the specified time.

.. command:: missile_distance <length-value>

   If the distance to the track is greater than the specified distance, it will not be considered to be a missile/weapon (not an aircraft). This allows filtering-out tracks at a long distance from being considered as missiles.

Range Settings
==============

.. command:: max_range_for_perceived_assets <length-value>

   Range limit to include an asset in the perceived asset list. If not specified, no range filter will be used for assets.

.. command:: max_range_for_perceived_bogies_and_bandits <length-value>

   Range limit to include a bogie/bandit in the perceived bogie/bandit list. If not specified, no range filter will be used for bogies or bandits.

.. command:: max_range_for_engagement_data <length-value>

   Range limit to report engagement data. If not specified, no range filter will be used on the reporting of engagement data.

.. command:: assumed_range_for_angle_only_targets <length-value>

   Range assumed for angle-only tracks. If not specified, the range for angle-only tracks will be assumed to be 2.0E+13 meters, which is greater than 100 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

   **Default:** 2.0E+13 meters

Filter Settings for Engagement Assessment
=========================================

.. command:: filter_requires_same_side <boolean-value>

   If true, filters out platforms that are not on the same side

   **Default:** false

.. command:: filter_requires_not_same_side <boolean-value>

   If true, filters out platforms that are on the same side

   **Default:** false

.. command:: filter_requires_air_domain <boolean-value>

Perception Commands
===================

.. command:: reports_self <boolean-value>

   Specifies whether or not to report out asset status messages about this platform.

   **Default:** true

.. command:: reports_others <boolean-value>

.. command:: reporting_others <boolean-value>

   Specifies whether or not to report out messages of all received and known asset status (of other platforms).

   **Default:** false

.. command:: asset_perception [ status_messages; truth <members> ]

   * *status_messages*: asset perception will utilize any received WsfSA_EntityMessage messages.
   * *truth <members>*: asset perception will traverse the command chain and use truth data.

      * <members> is a colon-separated list of 'commander', 'subordinates', 'peers', 'all_commanders', &/or 'all_subordinates'. Example:

     ::

        # Uses truth data for this platform's commander and all subordinates down the entire command chain
        asset_perception truth all_subordinates:commander

  **Default:** truth (but no members, so empty perception).

.. warning::
   At the present time, with the SA Processor in a "beta" release, the **truth** option is recommended. In some situations, using the **status_messages** may result in some assets being dropped due to purge problems. This will be addressed in the future.

.. command:: perceive_self

   Include this platform in the list of perceived assets.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: max_threat_load <integer>

   Specifies the maximum number of bogie/bandit entities and unfocused groups (i.e. perceived items) that may be perceived.

   **Default:** -1 (no max limit)

.. command:: max_asset_load <integer>

   Specifies the maximum number of assets that may be perceived.

.. command:: use_simple_countermeasures <boolean-value>

   If true, the processor will use :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.num_chaff`, :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.num_flares`, and :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.num_decoys` as the initial countermeasure quantities. When :method:`WsfSA_Processor.DispenseChaff`, :method:`WsfSA_Processor.DispenseFlare`, and :method:`WsfSA_Processor.DispenseDecoy` are invoked, these quantities are simply decremented (nothing is physically fired).
   If false, the processor will model countermeasures using instances of :model:`WSF_CHAFF_WEAPON`, WSF_FLARE_WEAPON, and WSF_DECOY_WEAPON defined on the parent platform. When :method:`WsfSA_Processor.DispenseChaff`, :method:`WsfSA_Processor.DispenseFlare`, and :method:`WsfSA_Processor.DispenseDecoy` are called, the respective countermeasures are fired.

   This approach provides a simple means of using expendable countermeasures (CM), allowing weapon scripts to inquire how many CM are present when the weapon was fired and then checking again when the weapon detonates -- using the difference of the two quantities provides the number of CM that were dispensed during the weapon flight, which can then be used to model an effect of the CM upon weapon effectiveness.

   **Default:** false

Custom Scripts
==============

Optionally, the user may choose to override default behaviors and functionality of the :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` through the use of "custom scripts".

Custom scripts include the following:

.. command:: AssetConsiderationScoring (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script double AssetConsiderationScoring(WsfSA_EntityPerception aAsset)
      end_script

   This is an optional script used to measure asset importance, which is used to determine how strongly the asset should be considered for maintaining perception. If this function is present, it completely overrides the use of any script functions that try to set asset importance or unimportance. This is only useful when :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.max_asset_load` is defined, otherwise no limit will be imposed and importance is not necessary. Values returned by the script may be any value (positive or negative), but assets presenting negative scores will be discarded from consideration. High scores indicate a greater interest in the asset, as compared to others.

.. command:: BogieBanditConsiderationScoring (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script double BogieBanditConsiderationScoring(WsfLocalTrack aTarget)
      end_script

   This is an optional script used to measure bogie/bandit importance, which is used to determine how strongly the bogie/bandit should be considered for maintaining perception. If this function is present, it completely overrides the use of any script functions that try to set bogie/bandit importance or unimportance. This is only useful when :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.max_threat_load` is defined, otherwise no limit will be imposed and importance is not necessary. Values returned by the script may be any value (positive or negative), but bogies/bandits presenting negative scores will be discarded from consideration. High scores indicate a greater interest in the bogie/bandit, as compared to others.
   
   This is used along with MissileConsiderationScoring (below). MissileConsiderationScoring provides special scoring for missiles, whereas BogieBanditConsiderationScoring provides a general consideration scoring that can be used by both aircraft and missiles. BogieBanditConsiderationScoring may be used without MissileConsiderationScoring, in which case it provides scoring for both aircraft and missiles. If MissileConsiderationScoring is present, it will be used for all bogies/bandits that are perceived as missiles.

.. command:: MissileConsiderationScoring (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script double MissileConsiderationScoring(WsfLocalTrack aTarget)
      end_script

   This is an optional script used to measure perceived missile bogie/bandit importance, which is used to determine how strongly the missile bogie/bandit should be considered for maintaining perception. If this function is present, it completely overrides the use of any script functions that try to set missile bogie/bandit importance or unimportance. This is only useful when :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.max_threat_load` is defined, otherwise no limit will be imposed and importance is not necessary. Values returned by the script may be any value (positive or negative), but missile bogies/bandits presenting negative scores will be discarded from consideration. High scores indicate a greater interest in the missile bogie/bandit, as compared to others.
   
   This is used along with BogieBanditConsiderationScoring (above), to provide special scoring for missiles, whereas BogieBanditConsiderationScoring provides a general consideration scoring that can be used by both aircraft and missiles.

.. command:: UnfocusedGroupConsiderationScoring (script)
   
   .. parsed-literal::
      
      script double UnfocusedGroupConsiderationScoring(WsfSA_Group aGroup)
      end_script
     
   This is an optional script used to measure perceived unfocused group importance, which is used to determine how strongly the group should be considered for maintaining perception. If this function is present, it completely overrides the use of any script functions that try to set bogie/bandit importance or unimportance. This is only useful when :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.max_threat_load` is defined, otherwise no limit will be imposed and importance is not necessary. Values returned by the script may be any value (positive or negative), but bogies/bandits presenting negative scores will be discarded from consideration. High scores indicate a greater interest in the bogie/bandit, as compared to others.
   
   This is used along with BogieBanditConsiderationScoring (above), in that the score of an unfocused group is compared with the scores of bandits to determine whether the group that includes the bandit becomes unfocused, or the unfocused group is removed from perception.

.. command:: CreatePerceivedItemPruningArray (script)

   .. parsed-literal::
      
      script Array<WsfSA_PerceivedItem> CreatePerceivedItemPruningArray(Array<WsfSA_PerceivedItem> aThreatItems)
      end_script
      
   This is an optional script used to override the default behavior to keep the number of perceived items within :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.max_threat_load`.
   
   aThreatItems is the current list of all recognized groups, plus any newly considered entities. This list is sorted by increasing consideration score.
   
   The script should return an array containing all perceived items which need to be dropped in order to keep within the perceived item limit.
   
   It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their custom pruning function guarantees that the perceived item limit is maintained.
   
   The SAP's internal list of perceived items isn't updated until after this script returns. Use :method:`WsfSA_Processor.CalculatePerceivedItemCount`\(aThreatItems) to check the number of perceived items.
   
   **Default:** If no user defined script is present:
      1. While the number of PIs exceeds the limit, choose the focused, unimportant, non-focus-protected group with the least consideration score, and unfocus it.
      2. While the number of PIs still exceeds the limit, choose the entity or unfocused, unimportant, non-element-protected group with the least consideration score, and drop it.
      3. If the number of PIs still exceeds the limit, repeat steps 1 and 2, but ignore focus and element protection.
      4. If the number of PIs still exceeds the limit, repeat steps 1 and 2, but ignore importance.
      5. If the number of PIs still exceeds the limit, repeat steps 1 and 2, but ignore importance and focus and element protection.

      end_script

   This is an optional script used to calculate the operational/tactical "self-risk" as assessed by the :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`, considering only the risk faced by this platform. This should return a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0. This optional script will override the default calculation.

   .. parsed-literal::

      script double CalculateFlightRisk()
      end_script

   This is an optional script used to calculate the operational/tactical "flight risk" as assessed by the :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`, considering the risk that the flight of aircraft (often two or four aircraft) is facing. This should return a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0. This optional script will override the default calculation.

This should return a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0. This optional script will override the default calculation.

   **Default:** If no user defined script is present, the mission risk is computed as the highest risk posed by any bogie or bandit in the perceived bogies list and bandits list.

.. command:: CalculateDefensiveness (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script double CalculateDefensiveness()
      end_script

   This is an optional script used to calculate the degree of defensiveness that the platform has assessed for the current operational/tactical situation as assessed by the :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`. This should return a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0. This optional script will override the default calculation.

   **Default:** If no user defined script is present, the defensiveness is computed as the highest defensiveness posed by any bogie or bandit.

.. command:: CalculateUrgency (script)

.. command:: CalculateWeaponSupport (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script bool CalculateWeaponSupport()
      end_script

   This is an optional script used to calculate if a weapon is being supported (i.e., is being provided track update information by the parent platform). If a weapon is being supported, it should return true. There is no default implementation for weapon support, so if this function is omitted, the weapon support condition will always be false.
