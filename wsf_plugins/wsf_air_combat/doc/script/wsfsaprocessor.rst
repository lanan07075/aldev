Prediction Methods
==================

All methods project the location of ``aEntity`` at a time ``aSimTime`` in the future (seconds), and can be replaced by different logic by defining a custom script with the correct signature.

The purpose of providing these functions, rather than leaving implementation entirely to the user, is multi-fold:

* Providing simple, fast building blocks which have been compiled into code

* Facilitating future visualization of predictions in Air Combat tools

* Providing an accessible starting point for newcomers

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionInTime(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity)

   Extrapolates based on the underlying track extrapolation behavior. This is intended to be a sort of sandbox function, where users can implement more complex predictions if they choose.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionForward(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity)

   Extrapolates based on perceived speed and bearing.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionLevelTurnLeft(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, double aGees)
.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionLevelTurnRight(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, double aGees)

   Assumes a simple geometric prediction of an aircraft maintaining an orbit with bank angle defined by ``aGees``.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionTurnToHeading(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, double aHeading_deg, double aGees)

   Assumes a simple geometric prediction of an aircraft turning to ``aHeading_deg`` with bank angle defined by ``aGees``.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionGoToPoint(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, WsfGeoPoint aPointOfInterest, double aGees)

   Assumes a simple geometric prediction of an aircraft turning toward ``aPointOfInterest`` with bank angle defined by ``aGees``. Assumes altitude hold. This will not be a perfect estimator, as it does not iterate to account for effects to the approach path imposed by the radius required to actually change heading.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionSlice(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, double aRollAngle, double aGees)

   Assumes a simple geometric prediction of an aircraft rolling from level flight to ``double aRollAngle`` and pulling through ``aGees``. Assumes a 180-degree change of heading. Assumes level flyout after change of heading is complete.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionSliceToHeading(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, double aHeading_deg, double aRollAngle, double aGees)

   Assumes a simple geometric prediction of an aircraft rolling from level flight to ``double aRollAngle`` and pulling through ``aGees`` until reaching ``aHeading_deg``. Assumes sharp transition to level flyout after achieving ``aHeading_deg``.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ProjectPositionSplitS(double aSimTime, WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, double aGees)

   By default, acts as a special case of :method:`ProjectPositionSlice<WsfSA_Processor.ProjectPositionSlice>` where the entity rolls through 180 degrees.

.. method:: WsfSA_EntityPerception BestTargetGroup()
   
   Returns the best target group.

Groups Methods
==============

The following methods provide perceived group (:class:`WsfSA_Group`) support in the :class:`WsfSA_Processor`.

.. method:: Array<WsfSA_PerceivedItem> PerceivedThreatItems()
   
   Returns an unsorted array of :class:`WsfSA_PerceivedItem` objects (perceived entities and unfocused groups).

.. method:: Array<WsfSA_Group> PerceivedGroups()
   
   Returns an unsorted array of :class:`WsfSA_Group` objects (perceived groups).

.. method:: WsfSA_Group GetGroup(string aName)
   
   Returns the :class:`WsfSA_Group` (perceived group) with the specified name. Use :class:`IsValid() <Object>` to verify value returned.

.. method:: bool RenameGroup(WsfSA_Group aGroup, string aName)
   
   If no other group recognized by the SA Processor has the given name, then it sets the name of aGroup to aName and returns true. Otherwise, it does not set the name and returns false.
   
.. method:: WsfSA_Group MergeGroups(Array<WsfSA_Group> aGroups)
   
   Merges the groups. Returns the merged group, or null if merging failed. If successful, all groups are deleted, and a new group is created, so the original groups should be considered invalid after successfully calling this function.

.. method:: Array<WsfSA_Group> SplitGroup(WsfSA_Group aGroup, int aNumber, string aSplitCriteria)
   
   Splits a group according to the aSplitCriteria enumeration. The number of entities specified by the aNumber argument will be added to a new group which fits aSplitCriteria. The remainder will be put into the other created group. If successful, the input group is deleted, so the original group should be considered invalid after successfully calling this function. Returns an array containing the two new groups if successful, with the remainder of the original first, followed by the new group defined by the split criteria and the given number of elements. Otherwise, it returns an empty array.
   
   aSplitCriteria can be any of the following:
   
   * "maximum threat"
   * "minimum threat"
   * "maximum target"
   * "minimum target"
   * "maximum altitude"
   * "minimum altitude"
   * "maximum distance"

   * "rightmost from heading"
   * "leftmost from heading"

.. method:: WsfSA_Group CreateGroup(Array<WsfSA_EntityPerception> aEntities)

   Creates a new group and inserts all entities from the array argument into it. As an exception to the general approach, if an entity in the array is already in another group, it will be removed from that group, but that group will not be marked as protected. Returns the new group if successful, or null otherwise.

.. method:: bool DisbandGroup(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Disbands the group. This does not delete the entities within that group. Returns false if disbanding an unfocused group causes the PI limit to be exceeded, true otherwise. The group is deleted, so it should be considered invalid after successfully calling the function.

.. method:: bool TransferEntity(WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity, WsfSA_Group aDestination)

   Transfers the entity into the group. As an exception to the general approach, if the entity is already in another group, it will be removed from that group, but that group will not be marked as protected. Returns false if transferring an entity from an unfocused group to a focused one causes the PI limit to be exceeded, true otherwise.

.. method:: bool RemoveEntityFromGroup(WsfSA_EntityPerception aEntity)

   Removes an entity from a group, but does not delete the entity. Returns false if removing an entity from an unfocused group causes the PI limit to be exceeded, true otherwise.

.. method:: bool SetFocus(WsfSA_Group aGroup, bool aFocus)

   Sets a group to focused or unfocused depending on whether aFocus is true or false, respectively. Returns false if setting an unfocused group to focused causes the PI limit to be exceeded.

.. method:: bool GetFocus(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Gets the focus state of aGroup.
   
.. method:: Array<WsfSA_Group> FocusedGroups()

   Gets the set of all focused groups recognized by the SAP.

   * "descending target"
   * "ascending altitude"
   * "descending altitude"

.. method:: int CalculatePerceivedItemCount(Array<WsfSA_PerceivedItem> aItemList)

   Returns the number of PIs present in the given array.
   
.. method:: int PerceivedThreatItemLimit()

   Returns the maximum number of perceived threat items the SAP can recognize at once.
   This is the number given to :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.max_threat_load`.
   
.. method:: void SetGroupImportant(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Sets the given group as important. This does not change the importance of its elements.
   
.. method:: void SetGroupUnimportant(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Sets the given group as unimportant. This does not change the importance of its elements.

.. method:: bool GetGroupImportance(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Returns true if the group is marked as important, false otherwise.

Cognitive Loading Methods
=========================

.. method:: void AddExtraCognitiveLoading(double aTimeDelaySeconds)
   
   This will add a time delay to perception updating or any other cognitive task. This is provided to represent a condition where a platform or agent is busy doing some task and regular perception updating should be delayed. Be cautious when using this, since if it is called from a regularly updating script and a delay is added each time that is equal to or greater than the update interval, then no perception updating will ever occur.

Update Interval Methods
=======================

.. note::
   The aUpdateIntervalName string parameter in these methods matches the corresponding WSF_SA_PROCESSOR command names listed
   in :ref:`sa_update_interval_commands` and in :ref:`sa_update_interval_groups`.  For example, GetUpdateInterval("report_interval")
   will return the update interval setting established by the report_interval command.  The update_event_base_interval and asset_purge_lifetime
   command strings are excluded from valid aUpdateIntervalName options since they serve a different, but related purpose; however, separate
   methods provide access to these settings.

The following methods retrieve the individual and grouped update intervals:

.. method:: double GetUpdateInterval(string aUpdateIntervalName)

   Returns the active value of the update interval. If all the values in a specified group are not the same or the supplied aUpdateIntervalName is invalid, -1.0 is returned to indicate an error.

.. method:: double GetStartupInterval(string aUpdateIntervalName)

   Returns the update interval established at startup. If all the values in a specified group are not the same or the supplied aUpdateIntervalName is invalid, -1.0 is returned to indicate an error.

The following methods modify the individual and grouped update intervals:

.. method:: bool SetUpdateInterval(string aUpdateIntervalName, double aUpdateIntervalSeconds)

   Sets the active update interval for the specified aUpdateIntervalName. Returns true on success and false if there is an error.
   The specified aUpdateIntervalSeconds will be rounded to the nearest multiple of update_event_base_interval.
   To prevent rounding to zero, a positive aUpdateIntervalSeconds value less than update_event_base_interval/2 will be rounded to
   update_event_base_interval; however, a value of zero can be used to disable aUpdateIntervalName updates.
   
.. method:: void ResetUpdateInterval(string aUpdateIntervalName)

   Sets the active update interval to the startup value for the specified aUpdateIntervalName.

The following methods provide access to the asset_purge_lifetime setting:

.. method:: double GetAssetDataPurgeLifetime()

   Returns the active asset_purge_lifetime setting.

.. method:: bool SetAssetDataPurgeLifetime(double aAssetPurgeLifetime)

   Sets the active asset_purge_lifetime. Returns true on success and false if there is an error.

.. method:: void ResetAssetDataPurgeLifetime()

   Sets the active asset_purge_lifetime to its startup value.

Weapons Methods
===============

.. method:: string GetSelectedWeapon()
   
   Returns the name of the currently selected weapon. If no weapon is selected, an empty string will be returned.

.. method:: void SetSelectedWeapon(string aName)
   
   Sets the name of the selected weapon to the specified string.

   Sets the master arm condition to 'Armed' if true, 'Safe' if false.

.. method:: bool GetMasterArm()
   
   Returns the master arm condition. True indicates 'Armed' and false indicates 'Safe'.

.. method:: bool WeaponBayDoorsAreOpen()
   
   Returns true if weapon bay doors are open, false if the doors are closed.

.. method:: void OpenWeaponBayDoors()
   
   Sets the weapon bay doors condition to 'Open'.

.. method:: void CloseWeaponBayDoors()
   
   Sets the weapon bay doors condition to 'Closed'.

.. method:: bool SupportingWeapon()
   
   Returns true if a weapon is being supported (i.e. is being provided track information by the parent platform).

.. method:: bool ShootCueActive()
   
   Returns true if the shoot cue is active.

.. method:: bool ShootCueBlinking()
   
   Returns true if the shoot cue is blinking.

Warnings/Cautions Methods
=========================

The following methods provide various warnings/cautions in the :class:`WsfSA_Processor`.

.. method:: bool MasterWarningActive()
   
   Returns true if the master warning is active, else false.

.. method:: bool MasterCautionActive()
   
   Returns true if the master caution is active, else false.

.. method:: bool JammingDetected()
   
   Returns true if jamming is being detected, else false.

Expendable Countermeasures Methods
==================================

The :class:`WsfSA_Processor` supports the use of a simple, mission-level, expendable countermeasures (CM) approach through the use of the :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.use_simple_countermeasures` command.

If true, the processor will use :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.num_chaff`, :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.num_flares`, and :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.num_decoys` as the initial countermeasure quantities. When DispenseChaff, DispenseFlare, and DispenseDecoy are invoked, these quantities are simply decremented (nothing is physically fired).

If false, the processor will model chaff countermeasures using :model:`WSF_CHAFF_WEAPON` defined on the parent platform. At the present time, there are no corresponding models for flares or decoys. In this situation, when DispenseChaff is called, the :model:`WSF_CHAFF_WEAPON` will be fired, but if DispenseFlare and DispenseDecoy are called, nothing will happen, since no dispensers of those types are available.

This approach provides a simple means of using expendable countermeasures (CM), allowing weapon scripts to inquire how many CM are present when the weapon was fired and then checking again when the weapon detonates -- using the difference of the two quantities provides the number of CM that were dispensed during the weapon flight, which can then be used to model an effect of the CM upon weapon effectiveness.

The methods below provide the means to determine the current CM quantities as well as the ability to dispense CM.

.. method:: int QuantityOfChaff()
   
   Returns the quantity of chaff present.

.. method:: int QuantityOfFlares()
   
   Returns the quantity of flares present.

.. method:: int QuantityOfDecoys()
   
   Returns the quantity of decoys present.

.. method:: void DispenseChaff()
   
   Dispenses a unit of chaff, if available.

.. method:: void DispenseFlare()
   
   Dispenses a unit of flares, if available.

.. method:: void DispenseDecoy()
   
   Dispenses a unit of decoys, if available.

   Returns the name of the InfraRed Search and Track (IRST) track processor. If no such track processor exists, an empty string will be returned.

.. method:: string DAS_TrackProcessor()

   Returns the name of the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) track processor. If no such track processor exists, an empty string will be returned.

.. method:: string FLIR_TrackProcessor()

   Returns the name of the Forward-Looking InfraRed (FLIR) track processor. If no such track processor exists, an empty string will be returned.

.. method:: string EyeTrackProcessor()

   Returns the name of the eye (visual/eyesight) track processor. If no such track processor exists, an empty string will be returned.

.. method:: string PerceptionMasterTrackProcessor()

   Returns the name of the perception master track processor (PMTP). If no such track processor exists, an empty string will be returned. The PMTP is an optional track processor that can be used to augment the master track processor (MTP) of the platform. In many cases, the PMTP includes feeds from more sensors and/or track processors than the MTP -- in particular, it often includes eye sensors (aircrew eyesight) that do not route their tracks to the MTP. By using the a PMTP, additional perception can be provided by visual sensors (eyesight) that are not avionics and hence do not have an "electronic path" to the MTP.

Geometry Methods
================

The following methods provide geometry support, such as "angle off" and "aspect angle" calculations, including 2D and 3D variants.

.. method:: double AngleOffTarget2D(WsfPlatform aPlatform, WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the 2D angle-off between the target and the platform (the difference in headings). This calculates angle-off as the angle between the headings of the target and the platform. A positive angle-off is when the difference in between the target heading and the platform heading is positive and is less than or equal to Pi. If the difference is negative and is greater than negative Pi, the angle-off is negative. The angle is in degrees.

.. method:: double AngleOffTarget2DSelf(WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the 2D angle-off between the target and the current platform (the difference in headings). This calculates angle-off as the angle between the headings of the target and the platform. A positive angle-off is when the difference in between the target heading and the platform heading is positive and is less than or equal to Pi. If the difference is negative and is greater than negative Pi, the angle-off is negative. The angle is in degrees.

.. method:: double AngleOffTarget3D(WsfPlatform aPlatform, WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the 3D angle-off between the target and the platform (the difference in heading/velocity). This calculates angle-off as the angle between the velocity vectors of the target and the platform. A positive angle-off is when the target is to the right of the platform. This is determined based on the y-vector of the platform. If the dot-product of the target's velocity vector and the platform's right side vector is positive, it is considered a positive angle-off. When the dot-product is negative, the angle-off is a negative value. The angle is in degrees.

.. method:: double AngleOffTarget3DSelf(WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the 3D angle-off between the target and the current platform (the difference in heading/velocity). This calculates angle-off as the angle between the velocity vectors of the target and the platform. A positive angle-off is when the target is to the right of the platform. This is determined based on the y-vector of the platform. If the dot-product of the target's velocity vector and the platform's right side vector is positive, it is considered a positive angle-off. When the dot-product is negative, the angle-off is a negative value. The angle is in degrees.

.. method:: double AspectAngleForTarget2D(WsfPlatform aPlatform, WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the aspect-angle for the target relative to the platform's position in 2D, meaning the aspect is based on a horizontal plane that contains the target, with the platform's position projected onto the plane. A positive angle is the "right side" of the target and a negative angle is "left side" of the target. The angle is in degrees.

.. method:: double AspectAngleForTarget2DSelf(WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the aspect-angle for the target relative to the current platform's position in 2D, meaning the aspect is based on a horizontal plane that contains the target, with the platform's position projected onto the plane. A positive angle is the "right side" of the target and a negative angle is "left side" of the target. The angle is in degrees.

.. method:: double AspectAngleForTarget3D(WsfPlatform aPlatform, WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the aspect-angle for the target relative to the platform's position in 3D, meaning the aspect is based on the angle between a 3D vector opposite of the target's velocity vector and the vector from the target to the platform's position. Right side (positive) and left side (negative) is determined based on the y-vector of the target aircraft. If the vector dot-product of the target y-vector and the vector towards the platform is positive, it is considered "right side". The angle is measured in degrees.

.. method:: double AspectAngleForTarget3DSelf(WsfPlatform aTargetPlatform)
   
   This returns the aspect-angle for the target relative to the current platform's position in 3D, meaning the aspect is based on the angle between a 3D vector opposite of the target's velocity vector and the vector from the target to the platform's position. Right side (positive) and left side (negative) is determined based on the y-vector of the target aircraft. If the vector dot-product of the target y-vector and the vector towards the platform is positive, it is considered "right side". The angle is measured in degrees.
