WsfSA_PerceivedItem
----------------------

.. class:: WsfSA_PerceivedItem

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfSA_PerceivedItem` provides a representation of a perceived item, which may be an entity perception or an unfocused group. Perceived items are key to the situation awareness component of the cognitive model, provided by the :class:`WsfSA_Processor`.

Perceived items are used within the "perception" and "assessment" modules of the :class:`WsfSA_Processor` (SAP). The SAP uses these perceived items to form various lists.

The first is an unsorted list of all perceived threat items. This list is not prioritized, although they may be limited due to range and/or scoring parameters when limited perception is enabled.

The next group of lists provide an assessment of the prioritized threats and targets, which are composed of bandits and bogies. These lists are prioritized, from highest threat to lowest threat and from the best target to the least attractive target. Threats are perceived items that present an adverse condition (a threat) to the platform, while targets are perceived items that the platform may wish to attack.

See :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` and :class:`WsfSA_Group` for lists of entities or groups in particular.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int ItemType()

   Returns the type of the perceived item. The item can be explicitly casted to its respective type.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Value
     - Identification
   * - 0
     - :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception`
   * - 1
     - :class:`WsfSA_Group`

.. method:: double Lat()

   Returns the latitude (deg) of the perceived item.

.. method:: double Lon()

   Returns the longitude (deg) of the perceived item.

.. method:: double Altitude()

   Returns the altitude (meters) of the perceived item.

.. method:: double Bearing()

   Returns the bearing (deg) of the perceived item.

.. method:: double Speed()

   Returns the speed (meters/sec) of the perceived item.

.. method:: double Heading()

   Returns the heading (deg) of the perceived item.

.. method:: double ThreatLevel()

   Returns the threat level of the perceived item. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: double TargetValue()

   Returns the target value of the perceived item. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: string PerceivedName()

   Returns the name of the perceived item. For entities, this is the perceived platform name. For groups, this is the group name.

.. method:: int Identification()

   Returns the identification of the perceived item.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Value
     - Identification
   * - 0
     - Unknown
   * - 1
     - Friendly
   * - 2
     - Neutral
   * - 3
     - Bogie
   * - 4
     - Bandit

.. method:: bool AngleOnly()

   Returns true if the perceived item is defined by an angle-only track. This will always be false for groups.

.. method:: bool AltitudeValid()

   Returns true if the perceived item altitude is valid.

.. method:: bool SpeedValid()

   Returns true if the perceived item speed is valid.

.. method:: bool HeadingValid()

   Returns true if the perceived item heading is valid.

.. method:: double SelectionScore()

   Returns the current selection score of the perceived item.

.. method:: double EstimatedTimeToIntercept(WsfPlatform aTarget)

   Returns the estimated time for this perceived item to intercept the specified target platform.
   If no intercept is possible, -1.0 is returned.
   If the perceived item is angle-only, or if it lacks speed data, no intercept will be calculated and -1.0 will be returned.
