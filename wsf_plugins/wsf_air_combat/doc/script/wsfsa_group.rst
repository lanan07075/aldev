WsfSA_Group
-----------

.. class:: WsfSA_Group inherits WsfSA_PerceivedItem

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfSA_Group` provides a representation of a perceived group, which may contain a list of :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` that make up the "elements" of the group. A list of the perceived :class:`WsfSA_Group` objects is provided by the :class:`WsfSA_Processor`, which provides the situation awareness component of the cognitive model. The :class:`WsfSA_Processor` also provides lists of groups prioritized by user-defined threat level or target value.

Groups may contain bogies or bandits -- known friendly or neutral :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` objects may not be a member of a group, and if an element of the group is later found to be a friendly or neutral, it will immediately be dropped from the group. 

Perceived groups include a centroid for the group, which is based on the locations of the elements of the group. If all elements of the group are removed, the group will be removed.

All groups are owned by a :class:`WsfSA_Processor`. Additionally, they can only be created or modified by calling group functions on the owning :class:`WsfSA_Processor`.

Methods
=======

.. method:: string GroupName()

   Returns the name of the group.

.. method:: double CentroidLat()

   Returns the group's centroid latitude (deg).

.. method:: double CentroidLon()

   Returns the group's centroid longitude (deg).

.. method:: double CentroidAlt()

   Returns the group's centroid altitude (meters).

.. method:: double CentroidHeading()

   Returns the group's centroid heading (deg).

.. method:: double CentroidSpeed()

   Returns the group's centroid speed (meters/sec).

.. method:: double RadiusCurrent()

   Returns the current radius of the group (meters).

.. method:: double RadiusMinimum()

   Returns the minimum radius of the group (meters).

.. method:: double LastUpdateTime()

   Returns the last update time (sec) of the group.

.. method:: int NumElements()

   Returns the number of elements (:class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception`) in the group.

.. method:: Array<WsfSA_EntityPerception> ElementList()
   
   Returns an array of :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` elements from the group list.

.. method:: bool GetFocus()

   Returns true if the group is focused, false otherwise.

.. method:: void SetElementProtection(WsfSA_Group aGroup, bool aIsProtected)

   Sets the element protection status of aGroup. When a group is element protected, it will not be automatically split or merged with another group.
   
.. method:: void SetFocusProtection(WsfSA_Group aGroup, bool aIsProtected)

   Sets the focus protection status of aGroup. When a group is focus protected, its focus will not be automatically changed unless there is no other option. A group being marked as important supercedes this.
   
.. method:: bool GetElementProtection(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Gets the element protection status of aGroup.

.. method:: bool GetFocusProtection(WsfSA_Group aGroup)

   Gets the focus protection status of aGroup.
