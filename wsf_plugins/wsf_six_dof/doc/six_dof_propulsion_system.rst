SixDOF Propulsion System Definition
===================================

The propulsion system includes thrust producers, such as turbojet engines, ramjets/scramjets, and
rockets (both liquid-propellant and solid-propellant), fuel tanks (which are containers for
fuel and or oxidizer) and fuel transfers (which define how fuel will be transferred between
tanks).

The propulsion_data_ block is used to define the propulsion system of a SixDOF object.
There is a great deal of flexibility in the propulsion_data_ which allows a wide range of fuel
system configurations. For example, the propulsion_data_ block for a Space Shuttle orbiter
would include three SSME (engines), but no fuel tank or fuel transfer definitions. The
propulsion_data_ block for a Space Shuttle external tank would include a fuel tank, but no
engines or fuel transfer definitions. The fuel feed for each SSME (defined in the 
liquid_propellant_rocket blocks of the propulsion system of the orbiter) would identify the
external tank fuel tank as their source of fuel. During runtime, the SSMEs would automatically
draw fuel from the external tank's fuel tank and when the external tank was jettisoned, the 
fuel flow would automatically be shutoff/terminated since there was no longer a connection.
   
.. note::

   Users may add a :model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_FUEL` to further define the fuel system, augmenting the
   fuel data provided in the **propulsion_data** block of the :model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_MOVER`, and
   including support for things like **bingo** fuel states and other simple, top-level 
   fuel-related data interaction.

Engines/Thrust Producers
========================

Each engine (thrust producer) **instance** on the vehicle is defined by an "engine" block. However, before an instance of an engine may be specified, the engine **type** must be defined.

Definitions of thrust producer types, including turbine-driven jet engines, ramjets/scramjets, liquid-propellant rocket engines, and solid-propellant rocket motors) are performed outside of a command:`WSF_SIX_DOF_MOVER.vehicle_type` block (but within a :command:`six_dof_object_types` block). These define 'types' of engines which can then be referenced from within a :command:`engine` block within a :command:`propulsion_data` block within a :command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type` or :command:`point_mass_vehicle_type` block. For more information about creating thrust producer types, see :ref:`SixDOF_Thrust_Producer_Types`.
    
The engine block defines how the engine is installed on a vehicle. The key parameters to include are relative position and attitude as well as the source of fuel. If no fuel
source (fuel tank) is specified, the engine will not produce thrust, since it lacks fuel. The exception to this is a solid-propellant rocket motor, since its fuel tank is created on instantiation.

.. command:: engine  <engine_type_name> <engine_base_type_name> ... end_engine

.. command:: rel_pos_x <length-value>

   This is the x-location of the thrust point relative to the parent's reference point using
   the parent's body coordinate system.

.. command:: rel_pos_y <length-value>

   This is the y-location of the thrust point relative to the parent's reference point using
   the parent's body coordinate system.

.. command:: rel_pos_z <length-value>

   This is the z-location of the thrust point relative to the parent's reference point using
   the parent's body coordinate system.

.. command:: rel_yaw <angle-value>

   This specifies the yaw of the thrust point about its reference point relative to the
   parent's body coordinate system.

.. command:: rel_pitch <angle-value>

   This specifies the pitch of the thrust point about its reference point relative to the
   parent's body coordinate system.

.. command:: rel_roll <angle-value>

   This specifies the roll of the thrust point about its reference point relative to the
   parent's body coordinate system.

.. command:: fuel_feed <string>

   This specifies the name of the fuel_tank_ from which the engine will draw fuel.
   Note -- This should not be defined for a solid-propellant rocket motor thrust producer,
   since its propellant is carried internally.

   
Fuel Tank Definition
====================

.. command:: fuel_tank <fuel_tank_name> ... end_fuel_tank
   :block:
   
   The fuel tank block provides a means to define tank parameters including fuel quantity,
   transfer rates, and center of gravity (cg). Multiple tanks can be defined, if desired,
   or a single tank may be used for simplification. In addition, a propulsion system does
   not have to contain a fuel tank; engines may draw fuel from tanks located in subobjects,
   for example. Conversely, an external fuel tank object has a propulsion system that only
   contains a fuel tank -- no engines are included.
   
   .. parsed-literal::

    fuel_tank <string>
       max_fuel_quantity_ ...
       current_fuel_qty_ ...
       max_flow_rate_ ...
       max_fill_rate_ ...
       max_xfer_rate_ ...
       cg_full_x_ ...

       cg_empty_x_ ...
       cg_empty_y_ ...
       cg_empty_z_ ...
    end_fuel_tank

   .. command:: max_fuel_quantity <mass-value>
      
      This is the maximum quantity of fuel that can be contained in the tank.

   .. command:: current_fuel_qty <mass-value>
      
      This is the current quantity of fuel that is in the tank.

   .. command:: max_flow_rate <mass-transfer-value>
      
      This is the maximum flow rate that the tank can provide to the engine(s). For proper
	  operation, this flow rate should exceed the maximum demands than the engine(s) may demand.

   .. command:: max_fill_rate <mass-transfer-value>
      
      This is the maximum flow rate that the tank can accept from an outside source, such as
	  an in-flight refueling source.

   .. command:: max_xfer_rate <mass-transfer-value>
      
      This is the maximum flow rate that the tank can accept from another tank or provide
	  to another tank.

   .. command:: cg_full_x <length-value>
      
      This is the x-location of the center of gravity (cg) of the fuel tank (when full)
	  relative to the reference point of the carrying vehicle, in body coordinates.

   .. command:: cg_full_y <length-value>
      
      This is the y-location of the center of gravity (cg) of the fuel tank (when full)
	  relative to the reference point of the carrying vehicle, in body coordinates.

   .. command:: cg_full_z <length-value>
      
      This is the z-location of the center of gravity (cg) of the fuel tank (when full)
	  relative to the reference point of the carrying vehicle, in body coordinates.

   .. command:: cg_empty_x <length-value>
      
      This is the x-location of the center of gravity (cg) of the fuel tank (when empty)
	  relative to the reference point of the carrying vehicle, in body coordinates.

   .. command:: cg_empty_y <length-value>
      
      This is the y-location of the center of gravity (cg) of the fuel tank (when empty)
	  relative to the reference point of the carrying vehicle, in body coordinates.

   .. command:: cg_empty_z <length-value>
      
      This is the z-location of the center of gravity (cg) of the fuel tank (when empty)
	  relative to the reference point of the carrying vehicle, in body coordinates.

Fuel Transfer
=============

Typically, fuel transfers are defined within the propulsion_data_ block. However, when external tanks (in subobjects) are present, fuel transfers may be defined outside of the propulsion system block (but still within the :command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type` or :command:`point_mass_vehicle_type` block).

.. command:: fuel_transfer <fuel_transfer_name> ... end_fuel_transfer
   :block:

   Regardless of whether a fuel transfer is defined within the propulsion_data_ block or a vehicle type block, a fuel transfer always consists of a source tank and a target tank. During runtime, the source tank will attempt to transfer fuel to the target tank, limited by the transfer rates of the two tanks.

   .. parsed-literal::

      fuel_transfer Fuel_Xfer
         source_tank_ ...
         target_tank_ ...

	         target_tank MainFuelTank
         end_fuel_transfer
      end_point_mass_vehicle_type

   .. command:: source_tank <string>
      
      The source tank is defined by its string name. Source tanks can be access on sub-objects by referencing the sub-object by name, then the source tank name (as shown above).

   .. command:: target_tank <string>
      
      The target tank is defined by its string name. Target tanks can be access on sub-objects by referencing the sub-object by name, then the target tank name (as shown above).      
            
      
Throttle Settings (RB6-only)
============================

These define the control input for throttles, thurst vectoring controls, and thrust
reversers. When these are defined in the propulsion_data_ block rather than the
engine type definition, the definitions apply to **all** engines on the vehicle
rather than only a particular engine. In most cases, defining in the
propulsion_data_ block is best.

   .. command:: throttle_setting_mil <string>
      
      This specifies the control_value defined in flight_controls that will be used to control the MIL (military) power throttle setting.
      
   .. command:: throttle_setting_ab <string>
      
      This specifies the control_value defined in flight_controls that will be used to control the AB (afterburner) power throttle setting.
      
   .. command:: throttle_setting_reverser <string>
      
      This specifies the control_value defined in flight_controls that will be used to control the thrust-reverser control setting.
      
   .. command:: throttle_setting_yaw <string>
      
      This specifies the control_value defined in flight_controls that will be used to control the yaw thrust vectoring control setting.
      
   .. command:: throttle_setting_pitch <string>
      
      This specifies the control_value defined in flight_controls that will be used to control the pitch thrust vectoring control setting.
