Overview
========

A unit formation can have no sub-formations, but are where the member platforms
of a formation hierarchy are specified. Unit formations cannot be defined at 
the root level in input files, and cannot have subformations. Units can also
be defined in script, see :class:`WsfSixDOF_Formation` and
:class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationManager`. Units can be given commands, see
:class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationCommand`.
