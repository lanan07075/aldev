Overview
========

:model:`WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER` is a specific type of :model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_MOVER`, using simple, first-order force coefficients for translation, and effects-based control to carry out rotation. 

In comparison to :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER` is less complicated to set up, requires less data, and is more numerically stable, but cannot reproduce the higher-order dynamics of a well-built :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER`.

Unlike a "full" 6DOF model, the point-mass model only uses a scalar mass property, and is unaware of mass distribution and the resulting moment-of-inertia tensor. Rotation capabilities are defined in table data, and are modified during execution to account for vehicle mass and flight conditions such as angle-of-attack, and air density. Rotation from thrust vectoring is also imparted according to table data, with the thrust force vector held static. 

   .. note:: 

      This limitation affects the construction of vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles. VTOL behavior can be approximated by including multiple engine instances in place of the same engine -- one in takeoff-and-landing configuration, and one in position for navigation -- and using script commands to ignite and shut-down the instances as appropriate.

:model:`WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER` does not support aerodynamic damping effects for either forces or rotation. Parameters are available for approximating static stability, but are not required.

PM6 Vehicle Type Commands
=========================

The most important command for a WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER is vehicle_type_, which defines the performance characteristics of of the object. The vehicle_type_ is defined as a :command:`point_mass_vehicle_type` in a :command:`six_dof_object_types` block. The vehicle_type_ must be defined before it is referenced in the **mover WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER** block.

.. command:: vehicle_type <string>
   
   This defines the type of object used by the mover. The point-mass vehicle_type_ is defined in a :command:`six_dof_object_types` block and must be defined before being referenced.
   
   The simplest WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER definition is something like this:
   
      mover WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER
		
         vehicle_type  F-15C
			
      end_mover
    
   This indicates that the F-15C vehicle_type_ will be used. F-15C must be a :command:`point_mass_vehicle_type` -- :command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type` objects will not be accepted.
