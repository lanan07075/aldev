SixDOF Integrators File Definition
==================================

The SixDOF integrators file is very simple. A single input line is used for each desired integrator.

The file format is as follows:

::

   integrators

     create_integrator  STANDARD_RIGID_BODY_INTEGRATOR

   end_integrators

This should typically include the default integrator (case-sensitive, STANDARD_RIGID_BODY_INTEGRATOR for Rigid-Body 6DOF and STANDARD_POINT_MASS_INTEGRATOR for Point-Mass 6DOF) unless all objects in the scenario use other integrators.
