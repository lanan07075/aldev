SixDOF Sequencers
=================

A SixDOF type definition may include one or more "sequencers" which provide a means for a SixDOF object to take action based on the occurrence of one or more events. Sequencers can be used to perform a range of tasks, such as deploying high-drag devices on a retarded-fall bomb several seconds after release from its parent aircraft, or triggering staging events on a multi-stage rocket. Sequencers are a powerful, yet easy to use, means of controlling a sequence of events
for a SixDOF object that can be triggered by events based on time, altitude, speed, etc.

.. command:: sequencer ... end_sequencer

   A sequencer block has an identifier, which is the string argument after 'sequencer'. This identifier must be unique within the vehicle type. 
   The sequencer block has to include at least one `Sequencer Actions`_, which is the action the sequencer shall perform when it is activated.
   The sequencer block may include one or more `Sequencer Events`_, if no Sequencer Events are provided the sequencer may only be activated through the :method:`WsfSixDOF_Mover.ActivateSequencer` script function.  
   The sequencer block may include one or more `Nested Sequencers`_ which will be used once the containing sequencer has been activated -- this allows for sequential events, where the second event cannot occur until the first event has occurred.

   An example of a simple, timer-event sequencer that jettisons two external fuel tank objects after 120 seconds has elapsed  is::

    sequencer DropTipTanks
       event_timer      120.0 sec
       action_jett_obj  RightTipTank
       action_jett_obj  LeftTipTank
    end_sequencer

Sequencer Events
================

Sequencer events are tested to determine if a sequencer should be activated. If more than one event is specified, the sequencer will activate if at least one of the events is true. If is it desired to activate only if all of the events are true, the all_events_ command should be included.

.. command:: event_timer <time-value>

   This event is based on reaching the specified time. The timer will begin counting once the sequencer is being tested. For top-level sequencers, this is equivalent to event_lifetime_ but if the sequencer is nested, its counter will not begin running until its parent sequencer has been activated.

.. command:: event_timer_int_msec <integer-value>

   This event is based on reaching the specified time, which is an integer number of milliseconds. The timer will begin counting once the sequencer is being tested. For top-level sequencers, this is equivalent to event_lifetime_int_msec_ but if the sequencer is nested, its counter will not begin running until its parent sequencer has been activated.

.. command:: event_timer_int_nanosec <integer-value>

   This event is based on reaching the specified time, which is an integer number of nanoseconds. The timer will begin counting once the sequencer is being tested. For top-level sequencers, this is equivalent to event_lifetime_int_nanosec_ but if the sequencer is nested, its counter will not begin running until its parent sequencer has been activated.

.. command:: event_lifetime <time-value>

   This event is based on reaching the specified lifetime. The lifetime timer begins counting once the platform is active (alive). This timer is different from the event_timer_ since it uses a platform-centric timer as opposed to a sequencer-centric timer.

.. command:: event_lifetime_int_msec <integer-value>

   This event is based on reaching the specified lifetime, which is an integer number of milliseconds.  The lifetime timer begins counting once the platform is active (alive). This timer is different from the event_timer_int_msec_ since it uses a platform-centric timer as opposed to a sequencer-centric timer.

.. command:: event_lifetime_int_nanosec <integer-value>

   This event is based on reaching the specified lifetime, which is an integer number of nanoseconds.  The lifetime timer begins counting once the platform is active (alive). This timer is different from the event_timer_int_nanosec_ since it uses a platform-centric timer as opposed to a sequencer-centric timer.

.. command:: event_above_alt <length-value>

   This event is based on the platform being above the specified altitude (MSL).

.. command:: event_below_alt <length-value>

   This event is based on the platform  being below the specified altitude (MSL).

.. command:: event_dynamic_pressure_above <pressure-value>

   This event is based on the platform having a dynamic pressure above the specified value.

.. command:: event_dynamic_pressure_below <pressure-value>

   This event is based on the platform having a dynamic pressure below the specified value.

.. command:: event_static_pressure_above <pressure-value>

   This event is based on the platform having a static pressure above the specified value.

.. command:: event_static_pressure_below <pressure-value>

   This event is based on the platform having a static pressure below the specified value.

.. command:: event_fuel_percent_below <real-value>

   Specify the fuel value as a normalized number (50% is 0.50). This event is based on the fuel level in the "main tank" being below the specified value. The main tank is considered to be the first tank specified in the :command:`propulsion_data` block.

.. command:: event_ground_distance <length-value>

   This event is based on the platform being beyond the specified distance (great circle) from the point at which it started.

.. command:: event_nx_above <acceleration-value>

   This event is based on the x-acceleration, known as Nx, (in body coordinates) being above the specified value.

.. command:: event_nx_below <acceleration-value>

   This event is based on the y-acceleration, known as Nx, (in body coordinates) being below the specified value.

.. command:: event_ny_above <acceleration-value>

   This event is based on the y-acceleration, known as Ny, (in body coordinates) being above the specified value.

.. command:: event_ny_below <acceleration-value>

   This event is based on the y-acceleration, known as Ny, (in body coordinates) being below the specified value.

.. command:: event_nz_above <acceleration-value>

   This event is based on the z-acceleration, known as Nz, (in body coordinates) being above the specified value.

.. command:: event_nz_below <acceleration-value>

   This event is based on the z-acceleration, known as Nz, (in body coordinates) being below the specified value.

.. command:: event_released_from_parent

   This event is based on the platform being newly released from its parent.
   
.. command:: event_manual_input_trigger

   This event allows a trigger pulled input from the P6Net interface to activate.
   
.. command:: event_manual_input_button

   This event allows an input button down from the P6Net interface to activate.
   
.. command:: event_manual_input_button_released

   This event allows an input button release from the P6Net interface to activate.
       
.. command:: event_boolean_input <string>

   This event is based on a :command:`flight_controls.control_boolean` within :command:`flight_controls` being true. This allows an event to be controlled by a ManualPilot or SyntheticPilot, for example.

.. command:: event_null

   This purpose of this event is for to prevent any action without an **external** command to active the sequencer (see action_activate_subobject_sequencer_).
   
.. command:: all_events

   This flag indicates that the sequencer will be activated only if all events for the sequencer are true.

Sequencer Actions
=================

.. command:: action_null

   This action should be specified when no action is desired, such as for a parent sequencer that does not need any action to be performed at its level.

.. command:: action_jett_obj <string>

   This action will jettison the specified subobject.

.. command:: action_jett_self

   This action will jettison the object from its parent.

.. command:: action_ignite_engine <string>

   This action will "ignite" the specified engine and set thrust (if applicable) to 100%.

.. command:: action_ignite_subobject <string>

   This action will "ignite" all engines on the specified subobject.

.. command:: action_ignite_self

   This action will "ignite" all engines on the object.

.. command:: action_terminate_thrust

   This action will terminate the thrust for all engines on the object (shutdown the engines).

.. command:: action_shutdown_engine <string>

   This action will "shutdown" the specified engine and set thrust (if applicable) to 0%.

.. command:: action_shutdown_subobject <string>

   This action will "shutdown" all engines on the specified subobject.

.. command:: action_change_aero_mode <string>

   This action will change the object's :command:`aero_mode` to the specified mode.

.. command:: action_enable_size_factor

   This action will enable the size factor. See :ref:`P6DOF_Size_Factor_Parameters` for details.
   
.. command:: action_set_graphical_model <integer-value>
   
   This action will set the current graphical model for networked tools.
   
.. command:: action_activate_subobject_sequencer <string> <string>

   The first string is the name of the subobject and the second string is the name of the sequencer. This action will activate the sequencer with the specified name on the specified subobject. If no subobject or sequencer exists, no action will be performed.
   
.. command:: action_enable_controls
   
   This action will enable control input for normal operation. See action_disable_controls_ to turn off the controls.
   
.. command:: action_disable_controls
   
   This action will disable control input, zeroing all control inputs. See action_enable_controls_ to turn on the controls.

Nested Sequencers
=================

Nested sequencers are sequencers that are defined within another (parent) sequencer. The nested sequencer does not have its events tested until its parent sequencer has been activated. This allows for sequential events, since the second event cannot occur until the first event has occurred. In many cases, the various parent sequencers will use an action_null_ action, since no action is desired until the final sequencer is activated.

Consider this case::

 sequencer
    name             Sequencer1
    event_above_alt  80000.0 ft
    action_null
    sequencer
       name             Sequencer2
       event_below_alt   70000.0 ft
       action_null
       sequencer
          name                  Sequencer3
          event_timer           10.0 sec
          action_ignite_engine  BoostRocket
       end_sequencer
    end_sequencer
 end_sequencer

In this case, the sequencer chain will ignite a BoostRocket 10 seconds after the platform comes back down below 70,000 feet after first reaching 80,000 feet.


Removing Sequencers
===================

.. command:: remove_sequencer <string>

   This removes the specified sequencer. It is typically used to remove a sequencer that was derived from a parent class object. If no sequencer with the specified name exists, the command is ignored.
