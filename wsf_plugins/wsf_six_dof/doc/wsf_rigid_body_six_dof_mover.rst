Overview
========

:model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER` is a specific type of :model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_MOVER`, using first- and second-order force and moment coefficients to effect rotation and translation. It is a direct descendant of WSF_P6DOF_MOVER, and adopts nearly all of its functionality.

The level of detail and data required to build a successful :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER` is nontrivial, but the result is a mover which is able to naturally capture phenomena and dynamics that other movers, including :model:`WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER`, cannot.

:model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER` uses only the principal (diagonal) elements of the moment-of-inertia tensor. This simplification helps to speed execution and reduce some complexity, but can have the effect of underdamping cross-coupling effects. Net forces and torques are aggregated from aerodynamic, propulsive, and gravitational sources, and are used directly in the equations of motion.

Aerodynamic coefficients are available for all degrees of freedom, including ``damping`` derivative coefficients. Not all are required, but each utilized table can add to the fidelity of a model.

RB6 Vehicle Type Commands
=========================

The most important command for a WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER is vehicle_type_, which defines the performance characteristics of of the object. The rigid-body vehicle_type_ is defined as a command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type` in a :command:`six_dof_object_types` block. The six_dof_vehicle_type must be defined before it is referenced in the **mover WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER** block.

See :command:`six_dof_object_types` for information on how to create a :command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type`.

.. command:: vehicle_type <string>
   
   This defines the type of object used by the mover. The vehicle_type_ is defined in a :command:`six_dof_object_types` block and must be defined before being referenced.
   
   The simplest WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER definition is something like this::
   
      mover WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER
         vehicle_type  F-15C
      end_mover
    
   This indicates that the F-15C vehicle_type_ will be used. F-15C must be a :command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type` -- :command:`point_mass_vehicle_type` objects will not be accepted.

.. command:: landing_gear_down <boolean-value>
   
   Indicates whether the landing gear should be down or not when the scenario begins.
   
   For the corresponding script methods, see :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.LowerLandingGear` or :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.RetractLandingGear`
  
.. command:: nws_enabled <boolean-value>
   
   Indicates whether nose-wheel steering should be enabled or not.  Nose-wheel steering is commonly used when taxiing but should be removed prior to the takeoff roll.
   
   For the corresponding script method, see :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.SetEnableNWS`
  
.. command:: parking_brake_on <boolean-value>
   
   This command sets whether the parking brake should be on or off when the scenario begins.
   
   For the corresponding script methods, see :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.SetParkingBrake` or :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.ReleaseWheelBrakes`
   
.. command:: taxi_mode_enabled <boolean-value>
   
   This command set whether the autopilot should be in taxi mode when the scenario begins.  This should be used only be used when the platform is on ground.
   
   For the corresponding script method, see :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.SetTaxiMode`
