SixDOF Aerodynamics Data
========================

Aerodynamics data is composed of two distinct categories -- aero_data_ and aero_component_ blocks. The 
aero_data_ block includes the aerodynamics produced by the object without any controls input or effects
from any movable surfaces/components. There is only one aero_data_ block, although it may contain additional
aero_data_ blocks within it that serve as aero sub-modes. An RB6 object usually contains multiple aero_component_
blocks, with one of more for each axis of control and/or for each control surface, depending on the level
of detail for the model.

Each of these command blocks are detailed below.

Point-mass vehicles and rigid-body vehicles share some aerodynamic data, but RB6 aero data is generally more involved.

Both types of vehicles use lift, drag, and side force coefficient data, but these tables should be produced in different ways.
While RB6 core data is produced with the control surfaces undeflected, PM6 data should be provided at the trimmed (net-zero-moment) condition.

Non-trimming devices, like spoilers and speedbrakes, are treated specially for PM6, and provide lift and/or drag coefficient increments as
requested.

Beyond those tables, very little is shared. Rotation is acheived for RB6 vehicles via the deflection of several individual control surfaces,
or, most simply, by a false control surface modeled as the sum of all contributions in a given axis. For example, a user could define effects for
LeftElevator, RightElevator, LeftCanard, and RightCanard, or could approximate the sum effect with a pseudo-surface named StickBackSurfaces.
In either case, coefficient increments for forces and moments are added to the system and contribute to translation and rotation.

PM6 vehicles use a different approach, which requires fewer pieces of data, but may also be less precise. Instead of moment coefficient data,
which must be compared to reasonable mass distribution data, PM6 uses data indicating the rotation acceleration available from a control axis.
In other words, if an aircraft is capable of creating a roll acceleration of 5 degrees per second per second, that information is input directly.

Similarly, stability is conferred to RB6 vehicles through moment coefficient tables. A restoring moment yields a stable aircraft, and a
destabilizing moment must be managed by a well-tuned autopilot or a very attentive pilot. For PM6, this can be approximated by a stabilizing
frequency. This frequency lacks a concrete physical analog, but can be considered as an inverse to a first-order lag response time. The aim
of this feature is to improve the realism of projectile trajectories. Piloted vehicles may also use this feature, but will likely see little benefit.

A positive frequency is stabilizing, and so confers a "weathervaning" effect where the vehicle rotates to point in the direction of travel. A
negative frequency is destabilizing. This is permitted, but should be used with care, if at all. The default value of 0 confers neutral stability,
so a tumbling object will continue to tumble, but a projectile with no initial rotation will glide unperturbed and perform visibly unrealistically.  

Core Aerodynamics Data
======================

This block defines the primary aerodynamics for the vehicle. The data includes one or more geometric parameters
as well as multiple stability derivative tables.  See :ref:`P6DOF Theory<P6DOF_FM>` for information on how this data is used in rigid-body models.
In addition, this block includes support for "aero modes", which allow a vehicle to have discrete aerodynamic modes,
such as a retarded-fall bomb that has two aero modes -- clean and high-drag.

.. command:: aero_data ... end_aero_data
   
   The RB6 geometric data offers two modes: wing-based or reference area. When using wing-based mode, the wing_chord_ft_, wing_span_ft_, and 
   wing_area_sqft_ should be specified. When using reference area mode, the ref_area_sqft_ should be specified. PM6 vehicles do not incorporate
   chord or span information, and so require only ref_area_sqft_.

   The RB6 stability derivative tables are each a function of mach and alpha (angle-of-attack) or mach and beta (angle-of-sideslip), as
   appropriate. The tables affect the base, non-controls aerodynamics of the vehicle. The secondary aerodynamics consist of control surface
   aerodynamics and are defined using aero_component_, which is completely separate from aero_data_.
	
   Additional data for PM6, such as rotation acceleration, are input as a function of Mach, and are modified on execution to account for effects
   from angle of attack and from altitude.

.. command:: wing_chord_ft <real-value>
   
   The mean chord of the wing measured in feet. This should be used along with wing_span_ft_ and wing_area_sqft_.

.. command:: wing_span_ft <real-value>
   
   The wing span of the wing measured in feet. This should be used along with wing_chord_ft_ and wing_area_sqft_.

.. command:: wing_area_sqft <real-value>
   
   The area of the wing measured in square feet. This should be used along with wing_chord_ft_ and wing_span_ft_.

.. command:: ref_area_sqft <real-value>
   
   The aerodynamic reference area of the vehicle measured in square feet. If this is used, wing_chord_ft_,
   wing_span_ft_ and wing_area_sqft_ should not be used.

.. command:: use_reduced_frequency <boolean-value>

   This should be **true** when using the "reduced frequency" stability derivatives. If **false**, the rate derivatives
   (e.g. :command:`cLq_alpha_mach_table`, :command:`cnr_mach_table`) will be multiplied by their corresponding angular rates.
   If **true**, the rate derivatives will instead be multiplied by a non-dimensional reduced frequency. For pitching moment and lift coefficient derivatives, the reduced frequency
   is calculated as the angular rate times the :command:`wing_chord_ft` divided by twice the speed. All other coefficient derivatives
   use :command:`wing_span_ft` instead of chord. See :ref:`P6DOF Theory<reduced_frequency>` for more information.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

.. command:: aero_center_x <length-value>
   
   The aerodynamic center (x-axis) of the vehicle relative to the reference point in object coordinates. This 
   "aero-center" is the "aerodynamic reference point" at which aerodynamic forces and moments will be calculated.
   The typical definition of aerodynamic center (as it relates to longitudinal stability) is the location at which
   the moment does not change regardless of the angle of attack. Thus, the pitching moment remains constant at 
   that particular point. Hence, the aerodynamic center, rather than the center of pressure, is used in the 
   analysis of longitudinal stability.

.. command:: aero_center_y <length-value>
   
   The aerodynamic center (y-axis) of the vehicle relative to the reference point in object coordinates.
         
.. command:: aero_center_z <length-value>
   
   The aerodynamic center (z-axis) of the vehicle relative to the reference point in object coordinates.

   The use of aero components can be simple, such as having three "generic" yaw, pitch and roll aero components,
   or can be more complex and realistic, such as having sixteen specific components: LeftAileron, RightAileron,
   LeftStabilator, RightStabilator, LeftRudder, RightRudder, LeftSpeedbrake, RightSpeedbrake, LeftFlap, RightFlap,
   LeftSpoiler, RightSpoiler, NoseLandingGear, LeftLandingGear, RightLandingGear, and ArrestingHook. During runtime,
   the position of aero components is controlled by the :ref:`SixDOF_Flight_Control_System_Label`.

   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the roll damping coefficient due to roll rate (clp) based on Mach 
   and the angle of the control surface.  

.. command:: clq_angle_mach_table
   
   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the roll damping coefficient due to pitch rate (clq) based on Mach 
   and the angle of the control surface.

.. command:: clr_angle_mach_table
   
   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the roll damping coefficient due to yaw rate (clr) based on Mach 
   and the angle of the control surface.
