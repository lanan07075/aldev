Overview
========

A six_dof_object_types block is used to specify various **types** of SixDOF objects, subobjects, components (such as engines), and environmental infrastructure (such as terrain). Once defined, a :command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type` or :command:`point_mass_vehicle_type` can be used when defining a :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER` or :model:`WSF_POINT_MASS_SIX_DOF_MOVER`.

Multiple six_dof_object_types_ blocks may be utilized. Types defined in the six_dof_object_types_ blocks must be uniquely named. In addition, a type must be defined before it is referenced. As a result, the order in which types are defined is important. Types should be defined in the order in which they are referenced. Thus, if a "F2H_Banshee" rigid-body aircraft uses "Westinghouse_J34" jet engines, the engine type (:command:`rigid_body_engine_type`) should be defined first, followed by the aircraft (:command:`rigid_body_vehicle_type`).

SixDOF Integrators Support
==========================

SixDOF was designed with the ability to use different numerical integration approaches. These different integrators are "loaded" through the use of the integrators_ command.

At the current time, only a single (default) integrator is provided, but software developers can derive from the base class (WsfSixDOF_Integrator) to introduce other integrators.

.. command:: integrators <file-name>

   This will load one or more SixDOF integrators by reading/loading the specified file.
   
   See :ref:`SixDOF_Integrators_File_Definition` for the definition of the integrators file format.
   
The integrators_ line can be defined independently, but is often grouped into a another file (typically six_dof_environment.txt) along with the `SixDOF Environment Support`_ items.

SixDOF Environment Support
==========================

SixDOF movers lean on the AFSIM scenario-local information for most environmental components. These include atmosphere, wind, terrain, and gravity. 
AFSIM terrain can be augmented to specify areas like airfields, where noise in other terrain data may have an adverse affect on landing, takeoff, or taxi operations.

.. command:: terrain  <file-name>

   Create a SixDOF terrain object using the specified file. Only a single terrain object should be defined for a given scenario.

   See :ref:`SixDOF_Terrain_File_Definition` for the definition of the terrain file format.

A integrators_ command is also typically included in the file for convenience.

It may also be convenient to define a :command:`atmosphere_table` block here. If one is not defined, the default :doc:`atmosphere` is used. This will lead to inaccuracies above 61 Km MSL, where the default atmosphere ends.
