WSF_SIX_DOF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER

Overview
========

:model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` is a processor that typically resides on a weapon and provides the guidance for a 
weapon whose mover is a :model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_MOVER`.

It uses the track provided through :method:`CurrentTargetTrack <WsfPlatform.CurrentTargetTrack>` to represent the target
to be pursued. The mover invokes this processor to request guidance updates. The processor computes the desired 
guidance and supplies commands back to the mover.

This is a re-implementation of the :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`-specific :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` for
:model:`WSF_SIX_DOF_MOVER` objects, and it is reasonable to expect similar behavior and functionality. Code maintainers
should periodically update this class to match :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` wherever simple inheritance is not possible.

Unsupported Methods
===================

The following methods (inherited from :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER`) are not supported at this time.

.. command:: commanded_throttle <real-value>

   Specifies a throttle factor in the range [0..1] that overrides and throttle specification in the mover.   
   
   Instead of using this command, consider commanding the vehicle's throttle via script.
   
   **Default:** No commanded throttle.
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedThrottle`
