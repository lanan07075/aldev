**Input type:** :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER`

Landing Gear
============

.. method:: void RetractLandingGear()
   
   Retract the landing gear. SixDOF includes the drag from extended landing gear.

.. method:: void LowerLandingGear()

   Extend the landing gear.

.. method:: double GetLandingGearPosition()
   
   Returns the angle (deg) of the landing gear. Zero is retracted and 90 deg is full down and locked.
   The angle is the average of all gear (left main gear, right main gear, and nose gear).

.. method:: bool WeightOnWheels()
   
   Returns true if any landing gear is compressed due to weight being on it. This can be used to
   detect when an aircraft is airborne (when taking off) or when an aircraft has touched down
   (when landing).

.. method:: bool WeightOnNoseWheel()
   
   Returns true if the nose landing gear is compressed due to weight being on the nose gear.

.. method:: void SetEnableNWS(bool aEnable)
   
   Enable or disable nose wheel steering (NWS). When NWS is active, the nose wheel will be able to
   rotate through a larger angle than when NWS is inactive, allowing a tighter turn radius. Nose-wheel
   steering is often used when taxiing, but should typically be removed prior to the takeoff roll
   and before landing.

.. method:: double GetNoseWheelAngle()
   
   Returns the angle (deg) of the nose wheel steering. Zero is centered, positive is to the right
   and negative is to the left.


Ground Operations
=================

These functions allow script control of ground operations. In most cases, EnableDirectBraking should be
called before calling these functions. When there is no further need for these functions,
ReleaseDirectBraking should be called (unless the parking brake is set, in which case
EnableDirectBraking should remain active, to hold the brakes).
  
.. method:: void EnableDirectBraking()
   
   This must be called to allow direct control of wheel brakes, overriding any autopilot control of
   brakes. If no further direct control of wheel brakes is required, ReleaseDirectBraking should be called.

.. method:: void SetParkingBrake()

   Set the "parking brake", which applies full braking to both wheel brakes of the landing gear of the mover.

.. method:: void ApplyLeftGearBrake(double aNormalizedBrakingValue)

   Apply the specified braking level to the left wheel brake on the landing gear of the mover.
   Values range from 0.0 (no braking) to 1.0 (full braking).

.. method:: void ApplyRightGearBrake(double aNormalizedBrakingValue)

   Apply the specified braking level to the right wheel brake on the landing gear of the mover.
   Values range from 0.0 (no braking) to 1.0 (full braking).

.. method:: void ReleaseWheelBrakes()

   Release all wheel brakes.

.. method:: void ReleaseDirectBraking()
   
   This disables direct control of wheel brakes, restoring control to the autopilot. It essentially
   "cancels" the EnableDirectBraking function.


External Forces
===============

The functions provide support to apply an external force to the vehicle or to remove such a force.

.. method:: void ApplyExternalForce(double aMagnitude, double aAngle)

   This method applies a force with magnitude equal to aMagnitude (in Newtons) with an angle of aAngle (deg)
   to the nose wheel of the model. This method is only intended to be used on ground operations and is
   useful to simulate pushing back from the gate or towing an aircraft. It can also be used to simulate
   a catapult on an aircraft carrier. An angle of 0 deg represents a force being pushed against the nose
   wheel such that the plane will back up, while a force at an angle of 180 will make the aircraft roll
   forward. If the model does not have landing gear, this function will not do anything. The force is
   applied until :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.RemoveExternalForce` is called.

.. method:: void RemoveExternalForce()
   
   Removes any external force being applied to the mover. For more information,
   see :method:`WsfRigidBodySixDOF_Mover.ApplyExternalForce`


Autopilot Commands
==================

RigidBodySixDOF autopilot adds support for taxiing to the base SixDOF autopilot.

.. method:: void SetTaxiMode(bool aEnable)

   Enable or disable "taxi mode". Taxi mode should be enabled when an aircraft is
   operating on the ground so that the autopilot can utilize the appropriate controls
   (rudder instead of stick right, for example) when performing ground operations.

.. method:: void SetTaxiRadius()

   Set the minimum radius for turns when in taxi mode.


Autopilot Current Settings/Limits
=================================

.. method:: double GetTaxiSpeedMax()

   Returns the maximum taxi speed in (m/s).

.. method:: double GetTaxiYawRateMax()

   Returns the maximum yaw rate (deg/s) when in taxi mode.


Autopilot Limit Modifications
=============================

.. method:: void SetTaxiSpeedMax(double aSpeed)

   This will limit the autopilot to the specified maximum taxi speed in (m/s).

.. method:: void SetTaxiYawRateMax(double aRate)

   Sets the maximum yaw rate (deg/s) when in taxi mode.


Control Inputs
==============

.. method:: void SetThrustReverserPosition(double aPosition)

   Sets the thrust reverser position. Valid values for aPosition are [0,1] -- 0 is
   normal (non-reverse) thrust and 1 is full reverse thrust. If there are no thrust
   reversers on the SixDOF model, this function does nothing.

.. method:: double GetThrustReverserPosition()

   Returns the current thrust reverser control input position (between 0 and 1).

.. method:: double GetLandingGearLeverPosition()

   Returns the current landing gear control input position (between 0 and 1).


Control Surface Positions
=========================

.. method:: double GetAngleOfControlSurface(string aControlSurfaceName)

   Returns the current angle (deg) of the specified control surface.

.. method:: Array<string> GetListOfControlSurfaceNames()

   Returns a list of control surface names for the vehicle.

.. method:: double GetAileronsBothPosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the ailerons. A positive value is trailing edge up on
   the right aileron and trailing edge down on the left aileron.

.. method:: double GetStabilatorLeftPosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the left stabilator. A positive value is trailing edge up.

.. method:: double GetStabilatorRightPosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the left stabilator. A positive value is trailing edge up.

.. method:: double GetRudderPosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the rudder(s). A positive value is trailing edge right.


Forces and Moments (F&M)
========================

.. method:: double GetYawMoment()

   Returns the current yaw moment in Newton-meters.

.. method:: double GetPitchMoment()

   Returns the current pitch moment in Newton-meters.

.. method:: double GetRollMoment()

   Returns the current roll moment in Newton-meters.
