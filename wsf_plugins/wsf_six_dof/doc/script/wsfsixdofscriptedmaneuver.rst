WsfSixDOF_ScriptedManeuver
--------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_ScriptedManeuver inherits WsfSixDOF_Maneuver

Overview
========

Construct a maneuver that uses a user-supplied script to perform the execution
of the maneuver.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_ScriptedManeuver Construct(string aScriptName)

   Construct a maneuver that uses the provided script at global context to
   perform the execution of the maneuver.

   When executed, this maneuver will call into the provided script one or more
   times, with each call providing the time of the call, and the mover to which
   the maneuver was assigned. The script should return the time of the next
   execution. If no further calls of the script are needed, it should return
   a time before the current simulation time.

   For example, the following script would produce a maneuver that will 
   print out a message once before completing:

   ::

      script double SampleManeuverScript(double aSimTime, WsfSixDOF_Mover aMover)
         writeln("Hello from a scripted maneuver!");
         return -1.0;
      end_script

      ...

      WsfSixDOF_ScriptedManeuver mvr = WsfSixDOF_ScriptedManeuver.Construct("SampleManeuverScript");

      ...
