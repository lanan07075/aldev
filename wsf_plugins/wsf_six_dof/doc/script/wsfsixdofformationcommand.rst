WsfSixDOF_FormationCommand
--------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_FormationCommand

Commands are the means by which a formation can be made to take actions. For a
command to be executed it must be assigned to a formation. Commands can be
constrained to execute only once a :class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint` is
satisfied. When executed by a :class:`WsfSixDOF_Formation`, a command may be
assigned to that formation causing it to perform some action, it may be
transformed and forwarded to the sub-formations of that formation, or both.

Methods
=======

.. method:: bool IsInstantaneous()

   Return if the command is an instantaneous command. Such commands only need
   to be executed once before they complete.

.. method:: bool IsSequence()

   Return if the command is a sequence of commands. See 
   :class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandSequence`.

.. method:: bool IsAssigned()

   Return if the command is assigned to a formation.

.. method:: bool IsPending()

   Return if the command is pending. A pending command has been assigned, but
   has not yet satisfied its constraint.

.. method:: bool IsExecuting()

   Return if the command is executing. An executing command has satisfied its
   constraint, but has yet to finish the action of the command itself.

.. method:: bool IsCompleted()

   Return if the command is complete. Once a command has executed all of its
   work, it becomes complete. Once a command reaches this status it will no
   longer be updated.

.. method:: bool IsCanceling()

   Return if the command is in the process of being canceled.

.. method:: bool IsCanceled()

   Return if the command has been canceled. Once the command reaches this
   status it will no longer be updated.

.. method:: bool IsDropped()

   Return if the command has been dropped. A dropped command differs from a
   canceled command in that a dropped command will be completely removed from
   the simulation, while a canceled command remains in the simulation with the
   canceled status.

.. method:: bool IsRunning()

   Return if the command is still running. A running command might be pending,
   executing, or canceling.

.. method:: bool GetDebug()

   Return if extra debugging output has been enabled on this command.

.. method:: void SetDebug(bool aEnableDebugOutput)

   Turn on or off extra debugging output for this command.

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_Formation GetFormation()

   Return the formation to which this command has been assigned. This can 
   return an invalid object if this command is unassigned.

.. method:: void Cancel()

   Cancel an incomplete command.

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint GetConstraint()

   Return the constraint on execution of this command. This can return an
   invalid object if there is no constraint on the command.

.. method:: void SetConstraint(WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint aConstraint)

   Set the constraint on execution for this command.
