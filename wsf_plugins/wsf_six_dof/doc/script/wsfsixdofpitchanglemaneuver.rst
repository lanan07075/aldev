WsfSixDOF_PitchAngleManeuver
----------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_PitchAngleManeuver inherits WsfSixDOF_Maneuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets the target pitch angle of the platform to which it is 
assigned. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target is set, so if 
there is a need to wait for the achieved pitch angle to reach the target
value, a :class:`WsfSixDOF_ManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_PitchAngleManeuver Construct(double aPitchAngleDeg)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target pitch angle in degrees.

.. method:: double GetPitchAngle()

   Return this maneuver's target pitch angle in degrees.
