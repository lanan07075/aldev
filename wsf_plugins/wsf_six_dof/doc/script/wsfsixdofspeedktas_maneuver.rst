WsfSixDOF_SpeedKTAS_Maneuver
----------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_SpeedKTAS_Maneuver inherits WsfSixDOF_Maneuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets a target speed on the platform to which the maneuver is
assigned. This maneuver uses knots true air speed as its measure of
speed. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target speed is set,
so if there is a need to wait for the achieved speed, a
:class:`WsfSixDOF_ManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_SpeedKTAS_Maneuver Construct(double aSpeedKTAS)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target speed for the platform to 
   which the maneuver is assigned in knots true air speed.

.. method:: double GetSpeed()

   Return this maneuver's target speed in knots true air speed.
