WsfSixDOF_PitchDeltaManeuver
----------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_PitchDeltaManeuver inherits WsfSixDOF_Maneuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets a target change in pitch angle for the platform to which it
is assigned. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target is set, so if 
there is a need to wait for the achieved change in pitch angle, a
:class:`WsfSixDOF_ManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_PitchDeltaManeuver Construct(double aPitchDeltaDeg)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target change in pitch angle on the
   platform to which it assigned.

.. method:: double GetPitchDelta()

   Return this maneuver's target change in pitch angle in degrees.
