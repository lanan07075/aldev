P6DOF Terrain File Definition
=============================

A P6DOF terrain file defines one or more regions, with each region containing one or more locations. The purpose of the file is to define the altitude of terrain measured in feet above sea level. Its primary use is to define airport regions to support P6DOF ground operations.

The file format is as follows:

::

   p6dof_terrain

     region

       location
         lat       21.3178275
         lon       -157.92026310
         alt_ft    13.0
         minLat    21.27
         maxLat    21.37
         minLon    -157.97
         maxLon    -157.87
       end_location
      
       ...

There are two configurations for location blocks (as shown above).

The first location shows the fully defined approach, which defines the lat/lon (in degrees) and altitude (in feet) along with minimum/maximum lat lon values. This defines a location that is bounded by the max/min lat/lon. It is assumed that all terrain within that location is at the altitude specified.

The second location shows the partially defined approach, which defines only the lat/lon (in degrees) and altitude (in feet). In this case, the minimum/maximum lat lon values will be calculated, by adjusting values to be approximately 3 nautical miles (3 arc minutes) on either side of the specified lat/lon. It is assumed that all terrain within that location is at the altitude specified.

This allows various airports to be defined within a region and allows several regions to be defined as well. Grouping airports into several regions (rather than simply using a single region) can improve runtime performance.
