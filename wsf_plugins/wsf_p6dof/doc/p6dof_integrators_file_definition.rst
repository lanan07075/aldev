P6DOF Integrators File Definition
=================================

The P6DOF integrators file is very simple. A single input line is used for each desired integrator.

The file format is as follows:

::

   p6dof_integrators

     create_integrator  STANDARD_P6DOF_INTEGRATOR

   end_p6dof_integrators

This should typically include the default integrator (STANDARD_P6DOF_INTEGRATOR -- must be all caps) unless all objects in the scenario use other integrators.

Return to :doc:`p6dof_object_types` or :ref:`P6DOF_Integrators_Support`
