P6DOF Pilot Manager and Control Inputs
======================================

Each P6DOF object may include one or more pilot objects (manual pilot, synthetic pilot, hardware autopilot, and/or
guidance system) to provide inputs to the flight control system. A pilot manager may contain/control one or more
pilot objects, although only one will be active at any point in time. The flight control system gets its input
from the "active pilot". The control inputs and configuration of pilot objects are defined through the
pilot_manager_ block.

.. command:: pilot_manager ... end_pilot_manager

The pilot_manager block defines control inputs, pilot objects, active pilot, and the common autopilot support file.

    end_control_inputs

.. command:: control_name <string>

   The primary purpose of the controls provider is to provide the multiple control_input feeds needed by the
   :command:`flight_controls`. Each control input represents the positioning and movement of various controls
   in the cockpit or control signals within autopilots and guidance systems. Control inputs are defined by
   the control_name_ command. The name must be unique within a given :command:`p6dof_object_type`. The
   :command:`flight_controls` will "connect" to control inputs via these control names. Typically, multiple
   control_name_ commands will be defined for each pilot_manager_.

   .. warning::
      The key concept is that each **control_input** in :command:`flight_controls` should be "connected" to a
      **control_name** in :command:`control_inputs`.

      The names must match exactly and are case-sensitive.

.. command:: std_stick_back <string>

.. command:: manual_pilot_simple_controls ... end_manual_pilot_simple_controls

The manual_pilot_simple_controls_ provides control inputs for the flight control system that are only modified by
simple control mapping tables.

   .. parsed-literal::

    manual_pilot_simple_controls

       pitch_control_mapping_table_ ...
       roll_control_mapping_table_ ...
       yaw_control_mapping_table_ ...

       simple_yaw_damper_ ...

    end_manual_pilot_simple_controls

.. command:: manual_pilot_augmented_controls ... end_manual_pilot_augmented_controls

The manual_pilot_augmented_controls_ uses a control augmentation system (CAS) to generate control inputs for the flight
control system. The CAS uses a common controller (autopilot) to generate inputs based on manual control inputs. Manual
inputs for the control stick (right and back) are modified by mapping tables and a pitch_control_augmentation_factor_g_
and roll_control_augmentation_factor_dps_ to generate pitch g-load and roll rate commands (respectively), which are fed
to the CAS, which provides signals that serve as inputs to the flight control system. The CAS will strive to keep the
aircraft flying within its current limits settings. This allows the pilot to pull full stick back, for example, without
concern for causing a stall -- the AP will keep the aircraft below the max alpha angle, preventing a stall.

Note that the CAS-relevant autopilot channels should be tuned for best results. For bank-to-turn vehicles, this is
comprised of alpha (for g-load), beta (for controlled sideslip), and roll rate. For yaw-to-turn vehicles, this will
consist of alpha and beta (in this case, for lateral g-load). Manual roll control is disabled in yaw-to-turn CAS,
instead deferring to the autopilot's selected roll damper control mode (null control, zero-roll-rate, or
zero-bank-angle).

As a temporary measure, yaw augmentation control is informed by the pitch augmentation setting. For bank-to-turn
vehicles, the maximum beta command (in degrees) is set equal to the maximum pitch g command. For example, if
pitch_control_augmentation_factor_g_ is set to 6 for a vehicle, a 100% stick-back command will translate to a 6g pull,
and a 100% right rudder command will translate to a 6 degree sideslip. For yaw-to-turn vehicles, the same right rudder
command will result in a 6g pull to the right-hand side. In future releases, these will likely be separated into
different values, both in script and in Mover Creator.

    end_manual_pilot_augmented_controls

.. command:: manual_pilot_augmented_stability ... end_manual_pilot_augmented_stability

The manual_pilot_augmented_stability_ uses a stability augmentation system (SAS) to generate control inputs for the
flight control system. The SAS uses a common controller (autopilot) to generate inputs based on manual control inputs.
Manual inputs for the control stick (right and back) and rudder are mixed with stabilizing autopilot inputs, requesting
zeroed rotation rates. SAS commands have an input ceiling of 25%, with the remainder provided by the manual flight
control inputs. For example, while the vehicle is at a stable roll position, the average input of the roll SAS should
sit around 0%, and the pilot is free to contribute as much stick-right as she likes. If she opts to pull hard to the
right, the roll SAS will attempt to resist the new rolling action, possibly with a 100% stick-left command. This
contribution will be limited to 25% stick-left, leaving the pilot limited to 75% stick-right.

Because SAS is designed to work against a pilot, it is less broadly useful than CAS, but can still be worthwhile. CAS
will be the preferable option for airframes which tend toward instability through parts (or all) of their flight
envelope, like flying wings (unstable in yaw) or agile fighters (unstable or neutrally stable in pitch). Where SAS may
be most useful is in flying larger, more stable aircraft, particularly those which are further along in their life
cycle, and whose flight control systems may not be as accurately modeled by a CAS-style system.

Note that the SAS-relevant autopilot channels should be tuned for best results. Unlike CAS, which adds an autopilot
layer between the stick and the flight controls, SAS can be thought of as being applied on top of the direct stick
input. The relevant channels for all vehicles, then, will be pitch rate, yaw rate, and roll rate.

alpha_min_mach_table, alpha_versus_mach_cl_table, stick_zero_moment_mach_alpha_table, and 
effective_CL_versus_mach_alpha_table). These tables are used by the common controller (autopilot) to help predict
response and calculate feed-forward.

It is not practical to create this file manually, but a "helper" tool is provided to generate the file by running
the "GenerateSecondaryAeroFile.txt" in the **p6dof_demo/scenarios** folder/directory.

To create the file, begin by editing the file, changing the included model file path and the MOVER_TYPE to the
desired model. Next, run the scenario to generate the "autopilot_support_tables.txt" file. Copy the 
autopilot_support_tables.txt file to model's folder/directory.

.. command:: simple_yaw_damper <boolean-value>

If true, a very "simple" (but not realistic) yaw damper action will be used to zero any sideslip (beta), making the
pseudo 6DOF more like a pseudo 5DOF. This should only be used for bank-to-turn objects such as fixed-wing aircraft
but should **not** be used for yaw-to-turn objects such as missiles.

This command has a similar effect to use_simple_yaw_damper_ but is used on a manual_pilot_simple_controls_ which lacks
an inherent autopilot. The simple yaw damper will automatically be disengaged when operating on the ground and re-engaged
once the vehicle is airborne.

   This specifies how many times the speed channel middle-loop activates before the speed channel outer-loop activates.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
   
.. command:: control_method <string>

   This sets the control method. There are two main methods -- bank-to-turn and yaw-to-turn. Bank-to-turn involves
   banking/rolling in order to perform a turn, like a normal aircraft. Yaw-to-turn involves simply yawing to perform
   a turn -- no rolling/banking is used. The command string should be one of the following:

     * BANK_TO_TURN_NO_YAW (no yaw control)
     * BANK_TO_TURN_WITH_YAW (allows yaw control)
     * YAW_TO_TURN_NO_ROLL (no roll control)
     * YAW_TO_TURN_ROLL_RATE (zeros-out any roll rate buildup)
     * YAW_TO_TURN_ZERO_BANK (rolls to maintain a zero bank)

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
   
.. command:: use_legacy_beta <boolean-value>

   This enables/disables the use of the legacy_beta flag. This should be set to false when the new/improved beta
   calculations are desired. For example, Mover Creator uses the new beta calculations, so data files created
   by Mover Creator always set the use_legacy_beta command to false.

   The new beta calcuations help avoid the need for negative PID values for beta-related control.

   The default value is true.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
   
.. command:: min_taxi_turn_radius <length-value>

   The defines the minimum taxi turning radius that will be used by the autopilot when performing taxi ground operations.

   If undefined, the default turn radius is 50 feet (~15 meters).

.. command:: use_simple_yaw_damper <boolean-value>

   If true, a very "simple" (but not realistic) yaw damper action will be used to zero any sideslip (beta), making the
   pseudo 6DOF more like a pseudo 5DOF. This should only be used for bank-to-turn objects such as fixed-wing aircraft
   but should **not** be used for yaw-to-turn objects such as missiles.

   The use_simple_yaw_damper_ is most often used to reduce the amount of autopilot tuning, especially to reduce/eliminate
   roll-yaw coupling effects.
   
   The simple yaw damper will automatically be disengaged when operating on the ground and re-engaged once the vehicle
   is airborne.

PIDs
^^^^

The autopilot uses a collection of Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) controllers, which are control loop feedback
mechanisms. The autopilot supports a total of 20 PIDs (alpha, delta_pitch, vert_speed, pitch_angle, pitch_rate,
flightpath_angle, altitude, beta, yaw_rate, yaw_heading, taxi_heading, roll_rate, delta_roll, bank_angle, roll_heading,
forward_accel, speed, taxi_forward_accel, taxi_speed, and taxi_yaw_rate). Four PIDs are only used for ground operations,
so when these are not needed, this leaves a subtotal of 16 PIDs. However, many missiles (that use the yaw-to-turn
control_method_) will only need the alpha and beta PIDs.

During development of P6DOF models, the various PID control parameters must be set appropriately for proper control.
Adjusting the PIDs is often referred to as "tuning" the PIDs or "tuning" the autopilot. Aircraft typically require
that 16-20 PIDs be tuned, but missiles often require tuning for only 2 PIDs. As a result, it is typically significantly
easier to "tune" a missile autopilot than an aircraft autopilot.

.. _PID_Block_Label:

PID blocks may contain any number of commands, including the following:

   .. parsed-literal::

      <pid_name>
        kp_ ...
        ki_ ...

Gain Table
^^^^^^^^^^

Gain tables provide a means to have multiple sets of PID parameters that are interpolated for the current conditions.
They utilize a control_value_ which is based on dynamic pressure, giving the PIDs a means to be adjusted for different
flight regime conditions.

Each gain_table_ provides the same commands as a `PID_Block_Label`_, but **must** include a control_value_ command as
well, as follows:   

.. command:: gain_table ... end_gain_table

   .. parsed-literal::

      gain_table
        control_value_ ...
        kp_ ...
        ki_ ...
        kd_ ...
        max_error_accum_ ...
        low_pass_alpha_ ...
        ignore_large_error_accum_ ...
        ignore_small_error_accum_ ...
        kt_anti_windup_gain_ ...
      end_gain_table

.. command:: control_value <real-value>

   This specifies the "control value" for which the PID parameters are used. The value is specified in lbs/ft^2 of 
   dynamic pressure. The PID will interpolate between the appropriate control_value_ pairs based on the current
   dynamic pressure.

   when following a route (waypoints). A larger value will allow the vehicle to consider
   the turn to be complete and switch to route segment control rather than continuing
   to use turn control.
