.. _P6DOF_Platform_Mappings:

P6DOF Platform Mappings
=======================

P6DOF objects may contain P6DOF subobjects that do not have a :command:`platform` until they are jettison/released from their parent P6DOF object. For example, a fighter aircraft may contain several missile P6DOF subobjects. Such subobjects will lack a platform until they are jettisoned, even though they may contribute mass property and aerodynamic effects to the parent while captive. When such subobjects are jettisoned, the P6DOF/Platform Mapping is consulted to determine which type of AFSIM :command:`platform` should be created for the P6DOF subobject. The P6DOF object for the subobject will be 'inserted' into the :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` of the newly created :command:`platform`, automatically conveying the kinematics of the subobject to the :command:`platform`.

.. command:: map_p6dof_object_to_platform <p6dof_object_type_name> <platform_name> ... end_map_p6dof_object_to_platform

   Define a mapping between the specified p6dof_object_type and the specified platform type.
   
Example map_p6dof_object_to_platform_:

   .. parsed-literal::

    map_p6dof_object_to_platform

      FA-LGT               FA-LGT-Platform
      SAM-MR               TestSAM_Platform
      F-16C                F-16C

    end_map_p6dof_object_to_platform

Note that the same string name may be used for both the :command:`p6dof_object_type` and the :command:`platform`, if appropriate (if there is a P6DOF object type and platform with the same name).
