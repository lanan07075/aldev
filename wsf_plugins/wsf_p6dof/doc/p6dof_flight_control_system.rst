P6DOF Flight Control System Definition
======================================

The flight control system determines how control inputs from the active pilot object are routed/mixed to move control
surfaces, throttles, or other components/controls (such as landing gear, speed brakes, etc.). Many of the control
surfaces serve as inputs into :command:`aero_component` objects.

.. command:: flight_controls ... end_flight_controls
   :block:

   The flight_controls_ block defines various control surfaces/values (control_surface_, control_value_,
   and control_boolean_) that control the vehicle and/or effect its performance. The flight_controls_ block
   also defines various input/signal modifiers which are referenced within the control surfaces/values
   (control_surface_, control_value_, and control_boolean_) blocks. It is important to define
   `Control Signal Modifiers`_ before they are referenced in the `Control Surfaces and Components`_ blocks.

    end_flight_controls

Control Signal Modifiers
========================

The control signal modifiers provide a means to modify control input "signals" from the active pilot object. The modifiers
can be used repeatedly within the control_surface_, control_value_, and control_boolean_ blocks, as needed.

.. command:: mapping_table ... end_mapping_table
   :block:

   Mapping tables are used to modify a control input signal by modulating with a control value source. The control value
   can be a range of sources such as mach, alpha, g-load, etc. A table defines the relationship between the control value

   .. parsed-literal::
 
    mapping_table <string>
       type_ ...
       table_data_ ... end_table_data
    end_mapping_table

   .. command:: type <string>

      This sets the type of the mapping table. Valid types include:

      mach_mapping 
         Uses mach as the control_value

      ktas_mapping 
         Uses ktas as the control_value

      alpha_mapping 
         Uses alpha as the control_value

      beta_mapping   
         Uses beta as the control_value

      g_x_load_mapping 
         Uses g-load-x (Nx) as the control_value

      g_y_load_mapping 
         Uses g-load-y (Ny) as the control_value

      g_z_load_mapping 
         Uses g-load-z (Nz) as the control_value

      alt_mapping 
         Uses altitude as the control_value

      q_mapping   
         Uses dynamic pressure as the control_value

      signal_mapping 
         Uses a signal as the control_value

   .. command:: table_data

      This table maps a signal/input to an output/value). A typical table is like this:

      ::

       table_data
          irregular_table
              independent_variable control_value precision float
              independent_variable input         precision float
              dependent_variable                 precision float
              control_value 0.0
                  input   -1.0 -0.5  0.0  0.5  1.0
                  values  -0.8 -0.4  0.0  0.4  0.8
              control_value 1.0
                  input   -1.0 -0.5  0.0  0.5  1.0
                  values  -0.8 -0.4  0.0  0.4  0.8
              control_value 2.0
                  input   -1.0 -0.5  0.0  0.5  1.0
                  values  -0.8 -0.4  0.0  0.4  0.8
          end_irregular_table
       end_table_data

.. block:: flight_controls

.. command:: gain_table ... end_gain_table
   :block:

   This table maps a signal/input to an output/value). A typical table is like this:

   .. parsed-literal::

    gain_table <string>

       type_ ...
       
       simple_table
        # value   gain
          -12.0   0.0
          -10.0   1.0
          0.00    1.0
          10.0    1.0
          12.0    0.8
          20.0    0.1
          30.0    0.0
       end_simple_table
       
    end_gain_table

.. block:: flight_controls

.. command:: scalar_gain ... end_scalar_gain
   :block:

   The scalar gain consists of a name and a gain value. Once defined, a scalar gain can be used repeatedly within the
   control_surface_, control_value_, and control_boolean_ blocks to scale a control signal.

   .. parsed-literal::

    scalar_gain <string>
       gain_ ...
    end_scalar_gain

   .. command:: gain <real-value>

      This sets the gain of the scalar gain.

.. block:: flight_controls

.. command:: clamp_gain ... end_clamp_gain
   :block:

   Clamp gains are used to limit a signal between min/max values. The output of signal will be "clamped" to the minimum
   and maximum values.

   .. parsed-literal::

    clamp_gain <string>
       min_clamp_ ...
       max_clamp_ ...
    end_clamp_gain

   .. command:: min_clamp <real-value>

      This sets the minimum value that will be allowed to pass the clamp gain.

   .. command:: max_clamp <real-value>

      This sets the maximum value that will be allowed to pass the clamp gain.

Control Surfaces and Components
===============================

The control_surface_, control_value_, and control_boolean_ represent control surfaces and other components on the
platform that produce forces and moments or control actions on the vehicle.

.. block:: flight_controls

.. command:: control_surface ... end_control_surface
   :block:

   This defines a "control surface" or other component that can produce aerodynamic effects on the platform. Control
   surfaces include ailerons, elevators, elevons, rudders, spoilers, speedbrakes, etc. but also include things like
   landing gear, which can produce drag. See `Sample Control Surface`_ for an example of a control_surface block.
   
   Each **control_surface** is given a **name** that must be unique and must "map" to an :command:`aero_component`
   that will produce the effect of the control_surface.

   .. warning::
      The key concept is that each **control_surface** in the :command:`flight_controls` block should be "connected"
      to a corresponding :command:`aero_component`.
      
      The **control_surface** name and the **aero_component** type must match exactly and are case-sensitive.

   .. parsed-literal::

      control_surface <name-string>
      
         min_angle_ ...
         max_angle_ ...
         current_angle_ ...
      
         inputs_ ... end_inputs
      
         angle_mapping_table_ ... end_angle_mapping_table
      
         actuator_ ... end_actuator
      
      end_control_surface

.. command:: min_angle <angle-value>

   This sets the minimum angle of this control surface.

.. command:: max_angle <angle-value>

   This sets the maximum angle of this control surface.

.. command:: current_angle <angle-value>

   This sets the current angle of this control surface.

.. command:: inputs ... end_inputs
   :block:

   Inputs provide a means to modify a "control input/signal" from the active pilot object. If multiple inputs_ blocks
   are used, the output from each block is summed with the other inputs_ for a given control_surface_. This can provide
   a means to "mix" control inputs/signals to drive a particular control surface. For example, an elevon may mix signals
   from stick_right and stick_back inputs to allow the elevon to be used for both pitch and roll forces/moments.

   .. parsed-literal::

    inputs
       control_input_.. end_control_input
    end_inputs

.. command:: control_input ... end_control_input
   :block:

   .. parsed-literal::

    control_input <string>
       modifier_ ...
    end_control_input

   .. command:: modifier <string>

      This indicates which of the `Control Signal Modifiers`_ should be used. If multiple modifier entries are present,
	  they are performed in succession with the result from the previous modifier serving as the input of the next,
	  forming a "chain" of modifiers.

   .. warning::
      The key concept is that each **control_input** in :command:`flight_controls` should be "connected" to a
      **control_name** in :command:`control_inputs`.
      
      The names must match exactly and are case-sensitive.

.. command:: angle_mapping_table ... end_angle_mapping_table

   This table provides a means to "shape" the mapping of input to control surface angle. In many situations, a non-linear
   mapping will be used, with a reduced slope near zero and increased slope near the endpoints. This often improves the
   "feel" of controls and provides more control sensitivity near the zero point. Data in the table is normalized input
   mapping to a control surface angle in degrees.

   Sample mapping table::

    angle_mapping_table
       #input        angle_deg
       -1.00         -20.0
       0.00          0.0
       1.00          20.0
    end_angle_mapping_table

   In this example, a normalized input of +/- 1 results in a linear mapping to +/- 20 degrees.

.. command:: actuator

   This allows an simple model of an actuator.

   .. parsed-literal::

    actuator
       max_positive_rate_ ...
       max_negative_rate_ ...
       max_angle_ ...
       min_angle_ ...
       current_angle_ ...
    end_actuator

.. command:: max_positive_rate <angle-rate-value>

   This is the maximum rate that the actuator can move in the positive direction.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: max_negative_rate <angle-rate-value>

   This is the maximum rate that the actuator can move in the negative direction.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: max_angle <angle-value>

   This is the maximum angle to which the actuator can move.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: min_angle <angle-value>

   This is the minimum angle to which the actuator can move.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: current_angle <angle-value>

   This is the current angle of the actuator.

   **Default**: 0.0

   .. parsed-literal::

    control_value <string>

       min_value_ ...
       max_value_ ...
       current_value_ ...

       inputs_ ... end_inputs

   This is the minimum value of the control value.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: max_value <real-value>

   This is the maximum value of the control value.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: current_angle <real-value>

   This is the current angle of the control value.

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: control_boolean

   This defines a "control boolean" that can be used to drive "button", "trigger", and "switch" types of controls on the
   platform. A control boolean's output is either true (on) or false (off).

   .. parsed-literal::
    
    control_boolean <string>

       current_value_ ...
       threshold_value_ ...

       inputs_ ... end_inputs

    end_control_boolean

   **Default**: 0

.. command:: threshold_value <real-value>

   This sets the value above which a signal will be considered to be true (on).

   **Default**: 0.5
