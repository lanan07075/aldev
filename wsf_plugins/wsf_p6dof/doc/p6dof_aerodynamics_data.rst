P6DOF Aerodynamics Data
=======================

Aerodynamics data is composed of two distinct categories -- aero_data_ and aero_component_ blocks. The 
aero_data_ block includes the aerodynamics produced by the object without any controls input or effects
from any movable surfaces/components. There is only one aero_data_ block, although it may contain additional
aero_data_ blocks within it that serve as aero sub-modes. An object usually contains multiple aero_component_
blocks, with one of more for each axis of control and/or for each control surface, depending on the level
of detail for the model.

Each of these command blocks are detailed below.

Core Aerodynamics Data (Non-Controls Data)
==========================================

This block defines the primary aerodynamics for the vehicle. The data includes one or more geometric parameters
as well as multiple stability derivative tables.  See :ref:`P6DOF Theory<P6DOF_FM>` for information on how this data is used.
In addition, this block includes support for "aero modes", which allow a vehicle to have discrete aerodynamic modes,
such as a retarded-fall bomb that has two aero modes -- clean and high-drag.

.. command:: aero_data ... end_aero_data

   
   The geometric data offers two modes: wing-based or reference area. When using wing-based mode, the 
   wing_chord_ft_, wing_span_ft_, and wing_area_sqft_ should be specified. When using reference area mode,
   the ref_area_sqft_ should be specified. The stability derivative tables are each a function of mach and
   alpha (angle-of-attack) or mach and beta (angle-of-sideslip), as appropriate. The tables focus on the 
   base, non-controls aerodynamics of the vehicle. The secondary aerodynamics consist of control surface
   aerodynamics and are defined using aero_component_, which is completely separate from aero_data_.

.. command:: wing_chord_ft <real-value>
   
   The mean chord of the wing measured in feet. This should be used along with wing_span_ft_ and wing_area_sqft_.

.. command:: wing_span_ft <real-value>
   
   The wing span of the wing measured in feet. This should be used along with wing_chord_ft_ and wing_area_sqft_.

.. command:: wing_area_sqft <real-value>
   
   The area of the wing measured in square feet. This should be used along with wing_chord_ft_ and wing_span_ft_.

.. command:: ref_area_sqft <real-value>
   
   The aerodynamic reference area of the vehicle measured in square feet. If this is used, wing_chord_ft_,
   wing_span_ft_ and wing_area_sqft_ should not be used.

.. command:: use_legacy_derivatives <boolean-value>
   
   This should be **true** when using the "legacy" stability derivatives (which are **DEPRECATED** and should not be
   used in any new development).

   **Default:** false

.. command:: use_reduced_frequency <boolean-value>

   This should be **true** when using the "reduced frequency" stability derivatives. If **false**, the rate derivatives
   (e.g. :command:`cLq_alpha_mach_table`, :command:`cnr_mach_table`) will be multiplied by their corresponding angular rates.
   If **true**, the rate derivatives will instead be multiplied by a non-dimensional reduced frequency. For pitching moment and lift coefficient derivatives, the reduced frequency
   is calculated as the angular rate times the :command:`wing_chord_ft` divided by twice the speed. All other coefficient derivatives
   use :command:`wing_span_ft` instead of chord. See :ref:`P6DOF Theory<reduced_frequency>` for more information.

   **Default:** true

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

.. command:: aero_center_x <length-value>
   
   The aerodynamic center (x-axis) of the vehicle relative to the reference point in object coordinates. This 
   "aero-center" is the "aerodynamic reference point" at which aerodynamic forces and moments will be calculated.
   The typical definition of aerodynamic center (as it relates to longitudinal stability) is the location at which
   the moment does not change regardless of the angle of attack. Thus, the pitching moment remains constant at 
   that particular point. Hence, the aerodynamic center, rather than the center of pressure, is used in the 
   analysis of longitudinal stability.

.. command:: aero_center_y <length-value>
   
   The aerodynamic center (y-axis) of the vehicle relative to the reference point in object coordinates.
         
.. command:: aero_center_z <length-value>
   
   The aerodynamic center (z-axis) of the vehicle relative to the reference point in object coordinates.

----------

   support with the exception of an aero_mode (aero_modes can not be nested within each other). Each aero 
   mode name must be unique for that object.  Aero modes are typically changed using sequencers and the
   :command:`action_change_aero_mode`.

   If use_reduced_frequency_ or use_legacy_derivatives_ are not explicitly set within an aero_mode_ block,
   those undefined settings will be set from the settings defined (or left as defaults) by the parent
   aero_data_ block.

Movable Aerodynamics Data (Control Surface Aero)
================================================

Secondary aerodynamics include aerodynamic effects produced by control surfaces or other components, such as
landing gear, that produce aero effects as a function of angle. For example, retractable landing gear produce
significant drag when extended (angle of 90 deg) and no drag when retracted (angle of 0 deg).

.. command:: aero_component ... end_aero_component

   The use of aero components can be simple, such as having three "generic" yaw, pitch and roll aero components,
   or can be more complex and realistic, such as having sixteen specific components: LeftAileron, RightAileron,
   LeftStabilator, RightStabilator, LeftRudder, RightRudder, LeftSpeedbrake, RightSpeedbrake, LeftFlap, RightFlap,
   LeftSpoiler, RightSpoiler, NoseLandingGear, LeftLandingGear, RightLandingGear, and ArrestingHook. During runtime,
   the position of aero components is controlled by the :ref:`P6DOF_Flight_Control_System_Label`.

   derivatives.)
   When this derivative is used, **cd_angle_alpha_mach_table** and **cd_angle_beta_mach_table** should not be used.

   and the angle of the control surface.
   
.. command:: cn_angle_beta_mach_table
      
   This is a 3-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the yaw coefficient (cn) based on the Mach, angle of sideslip
   (beta), and angle of the control surface, with a table order of Mach-beta-angle-value.

   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the yaw damping coefficient due to yaw rate (cnr) based on Mach 
   and the angle of the control surface.
   
.. command:: cl_angle_mach_table
      
   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the roll coefficient (cl) based on the Mach and angle of the
   control surface, with a table order of Mach-angle-value.
   
   .. warning::
      This derivative is **DEPRECATED** and should not be used for any new development.
   
.. command:: cl_angle_alpha_beta_table
      
   This is a 3-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the roll coefficient (cl) based on the angle of the attack (alpha),
   the angle of slideslip (beta) and the angle of the control surface, with a table order of alpha-beta-angle-value.
   This derivative may only be used when use_legacy_derivatives_ is false.
   
.. command:: clp_angle_mach_table
   
   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the roll damping coefficient due to roll rate (clp) based on Mach 
   and the angle of the control surface.  

.. command:: clq_angle_mach_table

.. command:: cLFactor_angle_mach_table
      
   This is a 2-dimensional **regular_table** that outputs the lift factor based on the Mach and angle of the control
   surface, with a table order of Mach-angle-value. The lift factor is multiplied by the calculated lift. It is used
   for lift reducing components such as spoilers.  This is **DEPRECATED** and should not be used in new developments.
