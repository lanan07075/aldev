Overview
========

:model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` (derived from :model:`WSF_FUEL`) implements a fuel object that consumes fuel at a rate determined
by a :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`. A :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` must reside on the :model:`WSF_PLATFORM` for 
:model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` to function.

.. warning:: Be sure to only use WSF_P6DOF_FUEL for platforms that include a WSF_P6DOF_MOVER.
             If it is used on a platform that lacks a WSF_P6DOF_MOVER, WSF_P6DOF_FUEL will throw an exception. 

See :class:`WsfP6DOF_Fuel` for script methods.

Note that :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` provides it's own set of commands to define its fuel system as well as its own script
methods (:class:`WsfP6DOF_Mover`) to get/set fuel system conditions. :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` serves to provide a common 
fuel object and common script methods that are similar to other WSF_FUEL-based objects.

See :command:`fuel` for additional information about fuel objects in AFSIM.

Commands
========

.. command:: initial_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the initial quantity of fuel to be loaded on the vehicle. :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` will interact with
   :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` to set the initial fuel. Fuel will be added to internal tanks first, keeping the 
   percentage filled for each tank in sync. For example, if the initial_quantity was 75% of the total internal
   fuel capacity, each internal fuel tank would be filled to 75% and no external tanks would be filled.
   
   **Default** 0 kg

.. command:: reserve_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the threshold such that when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below this value, the platform is
   considered to be operating on reserves. If an on_reserve_ block is defined, it will be executed when this 
   state is reached.
   
   Note that this has nothing to do with FAA or ICAO reserve fuel requirements, which are based on additional
   fuel to get to an alternate landing site if unable to land at intended landing site. For simple day VFR, 
   the reserve fuel must be enough to cruise for 30 minutes. At night, this is increased to 45 minutes. Rules
   for IFR and commercial flights are more complicated, but the basic idea is to ensure enough fuel to get to
   an alternate landing site with additional fuel to hold at that location before landing.
   
   However, since the **reserve_quantity** is simply an arbitrary value, users can use this for whatever
   purpose they chose. For example, it could be used as a **Joker** fuel state, to augment the **Bingo** fuel
   state (below). (The Joker fuel state is typically defined as Bingo plus additional fuel to perform
   certain, mission specific, actions.)
   
   **Default** 0 kg

.. command:: bingo_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the threshold such that when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below this value, the platform is
   considered to have reached a BINGO state. If an on_bingo_ block is defined, it will be executed when this 
   state is reached.
   
   **Default** 0 kg

Un-Supported Commands
=====================

Since :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` interfaces with :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`, it provides a more detailed and realistic
fuel system than many other derived classes of :model:`WSF_FUEL`. As a result, some commands and methods provided
by :model:`WSF_FUEL` (and :class:`WsfFuel`) are not supported (and cannot be supported), since those commands
and/or script methods are inappropriate.

For example, the command **consumption_rate** in :model:`WSF_FUEL` is inappropriate, since a single value cannot
be specified. In :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`, fuel consumption is typically dynamically dependent upon the types of
engines and the throttle settings as well as the speed/Mach and altitude of the :model:`WSF_PLATFORM`. Hence, a
single value is not appropriate.

:model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` does **not** support the following fuel commands:

.. command:: maximum_quantity <mass-flow-value>
   
   The fuel capacity is determined by fuel tank definitions in a :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`. If **maximum_quantity**
   is specified, it will be ignored and :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` will output a warning.

.. command:: mode <mode-name>
   
   :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` and :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` do not use a fuel mode. If **mode** is specified, it 
   will be ignored and :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` will output a warning.

.. command:: consumption_rate <mass-flow-value>
   
   Fuel consumption rate is not a single/constant value for a :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`. If **consumption_rate**
   is specified, it will be ignored and :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` will output a warning.

Script Interface
================

Like :model:`WSF_FUEL`, :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` supports the following script blocks. Each of these scripts predefine the following
variables:

* :class:`WsfP6DOF_Fuel` this; // This fuel object
* :class:`WsfPlatform` PLATFORM; // The platform containing this fuel object
* double TIME_NOW; // The current simulation time

.. command:: on_bingo ... <script-definition> ... end_on_bingo
   
   Defines a script to be executed when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below the threshold defined by
   bingo_quantity_.

.. command:: on_empty ... <script-definition> ... end_on_empty
   
   Defines a script to be executed when all fuel has been expended.

.. command:: on_reserve ... <script-definition> ... end_on_reserve
   
   Defines a script to be executed when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below the threshold defined by
   reserve_quantity_.

.. command:: on_refuel ... <script-definition> ... end_on_refuel
   
   Defines a script to be executed when a refueling operation has been completed.

:model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` also supports additional script methods. See :class:`WsfP6DOF_Fuel` for more information.


Common Usage
============
   
The most common approach to using :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` is to define a fuel block within a platform type block. The following example
shows setting an initial loadout of 15,000 lbs of fuel with a bingo of 4,000 lbs:

.. parsed-literal::

 platform_type ...
    fuel WSF_P6DOF_FUEL
         initial_quantity  15000 lbs
         bingo_quantity     4000 lbs
    end_fuel
 end_platform_type
