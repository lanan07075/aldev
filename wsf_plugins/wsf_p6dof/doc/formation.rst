Overview
========

Formations provide the means to organize both logically and physically groups
of platforms having a :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`, which can then be controlled
as a group instead of individually. Formations can also be defined in script,
see :class:`WsfFormation` and :class:`WsfFormationManager`. Formations can be
given commands, see :class:`WsfFormationCommand`.

A formation is a hierarchy: a formation may have sub-formations defined,
which themselves have sub-formations ending ultimately at unit formations that
have member platforms (see :doc:`unit`).

Each formation has two identifiers, its *relative name* and its
*qualified name*. The relative name is used to identify a formation relative to
its parent, and is only unique among the set of sibling sub-formations. A
qualified name is a concatenation (using '.') of the relative names of each
formation of which it is a sub-formation. A qualified name can be used to
uniquely identify a formation.

For example, if a top-level formation with relative name 'yankee' has a
sub-formation with relative name 'alpha', then the qualified name of that 
subformation would be 'yankee.alpha'. If that formation then had a
sub-formation 'one', that would have the qualified name 'yankee.alpha.one'.

Formation Control
"""""""""""""""""

Each formation is either attached or detached from its parent formation.
When a formation is attached, its members will keep station relative to its
leader. The attached state is applied to each formation individually, so it is
possible, for example, to have most of a formation attached and a single
subformation detached.

The attached state of a formation impacts both station keeping for the members
of that formation, and the propagation of formation commands. Commands assigned
to a formation will often lead to commands also being assigned to subformations
of the assignee. However, most commands will not propagate to detached
subformations (:class:`WsfFormationAttachCommand` is one notable exception).

Controlling a formation is done by both assigning a :class:`WsfFormationCommand`
to a formation, and by directing the behavior of formation leaders directly.
When a formation leader is controlled directly
(e.g., by issuing a :class:`WsfManeuver`), the members of any attached 
subformations will keep station with the leader.

Sub-formation Commands
======================

.. command:: formation ... end_formation

   Define a general sub-formation. This block is identical to the top-level 
   input block.

.. command:: section ... end_section

   Define a section sub-formation. See :doc:`section`.

.. command:: unit ... end_unit

   Define a unit sub-formation. See :doc:`unit`.

.. command:: lead

   When prefixed before a sub-formation command, this indicates that the
   following formation defined is the lead sub-formation of the enclosing parent
   formation. Formation defined in input must have one (and only one) lead
   sub-formation defined.
