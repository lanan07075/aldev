WsfFormationAddSubCommand
-------------------------

.. class:: WsfFormationAddSubCommand inherits WsfFormationCommand

:class:`WsfFormationAddSubCommand` can be used to add a formation as a
sub-formation to which the command is assigned. This will add the given
formation as a sub-formation, but it will add it in a detached state. To
have the added sub-formation attach to its new parent, use
:class:`WsfFormationAttachCommand`.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfFormationAddSubCommand Construct(string aQualifiedName, WsfFormationOffset aOffset)

   Create a command that will add the formation with the given qualified name
   with the given offset to the formation to which this command is assigned.

.. method:: WsfFormationAddSubCommand Construct(string aQualifiedName, string aProposedParent, WsfFormationOffset aOffset)

   Create a command that works as above, but will instead add the formation
   as a sub-formation of one of the sub-formations of the formation to which
   the command is assigned.

   For example, the following will add the formation 'lead' as a subformation
   of 'yankee.alpha.one':

   ::

      WsfFormationAddSubCommand cmd = WsfFormationAddSubCommand.Construct("lead", "alpha.one", WsfFormationOffset.Construct(...));
      WsfFormation yankee = WsfFormationManager.GetFormation("yankee");
      yankee.ExecuteCommand(cmd);

.. method:: string GetFormationToAdd()

   Return the qualified name that this command will add as a sub-formation.

.. method:: WsfFormationOffset GetOffset()

   Return the offset with which the sub-formation will be added.
