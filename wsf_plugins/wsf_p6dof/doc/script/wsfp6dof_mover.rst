Landing Gear
============

.. method:: void RetractLandingGear()
   
   Retract the landing gear. P6DOF includes the drag from extended landing gear.

.. method:: void LowerLandingGear()

   Extend the landing gear.

.. method:: double GetLandingGearPosition()
   
   Returns the angle (deg) of the landing gear. Zero is retracted and 90 deg is full down and locked.
   The angle is the average of all gear (left main gear, right main gear, and nose gear).

.. method:: bool WeightOnWheels()
   
   Returns true if any landing gear is compressed due to weight being on it. This can be used to
   detect when an aircraft is airborne (when taking off) or when an aircraft has touched down
   (when landing).

.. method:: bool WeightOnNoseWheel()
   
   Returns true if the nose landing gear is compressed due to weight being on the nose gear.

.. method:: void SetEnableNWS(bool aEnable)
   
   Enable or disable nose wheel steering (NWS). When NWS is active, the nose wheel will be able to
   rotate through a larger angle than when NWS is inactive, allowing a tighter turn radius. Nose-wheel
   steering is often used when taxiing, but should typically be removed prior to the takeoff roll
   and before landing.

.. method:: double GetNoseWheelAngle()
   
   Returns the angle (deg) of the nose wheel steering. Zero is centered, positive is to the right
   and negative is to the left.


Ground Operations
=================

These functions allow script control of ground operations. In most cases, EnableDirectBraking should be
called before calling these functions. When there is no further need for these functions,
ReleaseDirectBraking should be called (unless the parking brake is set, in which case
EnableDirectBraking should remain active, to hold the brakes).
  
.. method:: void EnableDirectBraking()
   
   This must be called to allow direct control of wheel brakes, overriding any autopilot control of
   brakes. If no further direct control of wheel brakes is required, ReleaseDirectBraking should be called.

.. method:: void SetParkingBrake()

   Set the "parking brake", which applies full braking to both wheel brakes of the landing gear of the P6DOF mover.

.. method:: void ApplyLeftGearBrake(double aNormalizedBrakingValue)

   Apply the specified braking level to the left wheel brake on the landing gear of the P6DOF mover.
   Values range from 0.0 (no braking) to 1.0 (full braking).

.. method:: void ApplyRightGearBrake(double aNormalizedBrakingValue)

   Apply the specified braking level to the right wheel brake on the landing gear of the P6DOF mover.
   Values range from 0.0 (no braking) to 1.0 (full braking).

.. method:: void ReleaseWheelBrakes()

   Release all wheel brakes.

.. method:: void ReleaseDirectBraking()
   
   This disables direct control of wheel brakes, restoring control to the autopilot. It essentially
   "cancels" the EnableDirectBraking function.


External Forces
===============

The functions provide support to apply an external force to the vehicle or to remove such a force.

.. method:: void ApplyExternalForce(double aMagnitude, double aAngle)

   This method applies a force with magnitude equal to aMagnitude (in lbs) with an angle of aAngle (deg)
   to the nose wheel of the model. This method is only intended to be used on ground operations and is
   useful to simulate pushing back from the gate or towing an aircraft. It can also be used to simulate
   a catapult on an aircraft carrier. An angle of 0 deg represents a force being pushed against the nose
   wheel such that the plane will back up, while a force at an angle of 180 will make the aircraft roll
   forward. If the model does not have landing gear, this function will not do anything. The force is
   applied until :method:`WsfP6DOF_Mover.RemoveExternalForce` is called.

.. method:: void RemoveExternalForce()
   
   Removes any external force being applied to the P6DOF mover. For more information,
   see :method:`WsfP6DOF_Mover.ApplyExternalForce`


Sequencers
==========

.. method:: bool ActivateSequencer(string aSequencerName)

   Activate the sequencer specified by aSequencerName.  If the sequencer is not found, it will return false.
   For more information on sequencers, see :ref:`P6DOF_Sequencers_Label`


Maneuvers
=========

.. method:: WsfManeuver GetCurrentManeuver()

   This will return the current maneuver. This could be either a maneuver that is executing, or one
   that is waiting for either its entry or exit constraint to become satisfied. If there is no
   current maneuver, then this will return an invalid object.

.. method:: WsfManeuverSequence GetManeuverSequence()

   This will return the maneuver sequence that this mover is executing. If there is no maneuver
   sequence being executed, this will return an invalid object.

.. method:: void ExecuteManeuver(WsfManeuver aManeuver)

   This will execute the provided maneuver. If this mover is currently executing a maneuver, then
   that maneuver will be canceled and the given maneuver will be executed instead.

.. method:: void ExecuteManeuverSequence(WsfManeuverSequence aSequence)

   This will execute the given maneuver sequence. If this mover is currently executing a maneuver
   sequence, then that sequence will be canceled, and the provided sequence will be executed instead.

.. method:: void CancelManeuvers()

   This will cancel any currently executing maneuvers.


Autopilot Commands
==================

P6DOF autopilots typically utilize three "channels" for control -- vertical, lateral, and speed
channels. Each channel is independent, but the state of the air vehicle can effect all three
channels and each channel may influence the other channels. Recognizing that these three channels
are at the heart of autopilot functions can help users better understand how autopilot commands
might interact between channels. Autopilot control methods are presented below.

.. method:: void EnableAutopilot()

   This will "enable/activate" the autopilot. An autopilot must be enabled in order to function.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotAltitude(double aAltitude)

   This will not directly effect what the other autopilot channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotRollAngle(double aRollAngle)

   This will command the autopilot to attain and hold the specified roll/bank angle (in degrees).
   This will not directly effect what the other autopilot channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotRollRate(double aRollRate)

   This will command the autopilot to attain and hold the specified roll rate (in deg/sec).
   This will not directly effect what the other autopilot channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotDeltaRoll(double aDeltaRollAngle)

   This will command the autopilot to roll right (positive) or left (negative) by the
   specified angle (in degrees).

.. method:: void SetAutopilotSpeedKCAS(double aSpeed_KCAS)

   This will command the autopilot to attain and hold the specified speed in knots
   calibrated airspeed (KCAS, which is similar to knots indicated airspeed, KIAS). 
   KCAS and KIAS are effected by altitude (and air density). This will not directly
   effect what the other autopilot channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotSpeedKIAS(double aSpeed_KIAS)

   This will command the autopilot to attain and hold the specified speed in knots
   indicated airspeed (KIAS, which is similar to knots calibrated airspeed, KCAS).
   KCAS and KIAS are effected by altitude (and air density). This will not directly
   effect what the other autopilot channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotSpeedKTAS(double aSpeed_KTAS)

   This will command the autopilot to attain and hold the specified speed in knots
   true airspeed (KTAS). This will not directly effect what the other autopilot
   channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotSpeedMach(double aSpeed_Mach)

   This will command the autopilot to attain and hold the specified speed in Mach.
   This will not directly effect what the other autopilot channels are doing.

.. method:: void SetTaxiMode(bool aEnable)

   Enable or disable "taxi mode". Taxi mode should be enabled when an aircraft is
   operating on the ground so that the autopilot can utilize the appropriate controls
   (rudder instead of stick right, for example) when performing ground operations.

.. method:: void SetTaxiRadius()

   Set the minimum radius for turns when in taxi mode.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotWaypointMode()

   This will command the autopilot to set all three channels to waypoint mode.

.. method:: void SetAutopilotNoControl()

   This will command the autopilot to "zero" all controls, which will center the
   stick and rudder and pull back throttle(s) to zero (idle). It is similar to
   :method:`WsfP6DOF_Mover.EnableControls` but is commanding the autopilot,
   rather than the controls themselves.

   This sets a heavy damage level on the mover.

.. method:: void SetDestroyed()

   This will make the vehicle fall out of control. It allows a realistic crash
   motion rather than simply removing a dead vehicle. When destroyed, the vehicle
   will fall ballistically (using a zero pitch g-load), roll inverted, cut power
   to idle, and extend speedbrakes (if available) to slow the vehicle as it crashes.


Control Inputs
==============

.. method:: void EnableThrustVectoring(bool aEnable)

   Controls whether thrust vectoring is on or off. Thrust vectoring is off by default.
   If thrust vectoring is not supported on the P6DOF model, this function does nothing.

.. method:: void SetThrustReverserPosition(double aPosition)

   Sets the thrust reverser position. Valid values for aPosition are [0,1] -- 0 is
   normal (non-reverse) thrust and 1 is full reverse thrust. If there are no thrust
   reversers on the P6DOF model, this function does nothing.

.. method:: void EnableControls(bool aEnable)

   This enables/disables control inputs from any source (autopilot, external manual
   pilot, P6Net interface, etc.). Controls are enabled by default, so this command
   is typically used to disable controls (using false). This is often used to allow
   a weapon to drop ballistically and without control inputs as it is released from
   the carrying aircraft and then calling EnableControls(true) to establish control
   input after the weapon is safely clear of the aircraft.

.. method:: void TakeDirectControlInput()

   This must be called before using SetDirectControlInputs. If no further direct
   control is required, ReleaseDirectControlInput should be called.

.. method:: void ReleaseDirectControlInput()

   This should be called if no further direct control is required. It essentially
   "cancels" the TakeDirectControlInput function.

.. method:: void SetDirectControlInputs(double aStickBack, double aStickRight, double aRudderRight, double aThrottles)

   This sets the controls for the control stick (aStickBack and aStickRight), rudder
   pedals (aRudderRight) and throttle levers (aThrottles). Control stick and rudder
   pedal values range from -1 (full left or forward) to zero (neutral) to +1 (full
   right or back). Throttle values range from 0 (idle) to 1 (non-augmented, military
   power) to 2 (full afterburner). This function requires that TakeDirectControlInput
   be called prior to use.

.. method:: void EnableDirectThrottleInput()

   This allows direct throttle input, overriding any autopilot control of the throttle.

.. method:: void MoveThrottleToIdle()

   Sets and holds the throttle to idle power. EnableDirectThrottleInput must be called
   to allow this control.

.. method:: void MoveThrottleToFull()

   Sets and holds the throttle to military (MIL) power. EnableDirectThrottleInput must
   be called to allow this control.

.. method:: void MoveThrottleToMilitary()

   Sets and holds the throttle to military (MIL) power. EnableDirectThrottleInput must
   be called to allow this control.

.. method:: void MoveThrottleToAfterburner()

   Sets and holds the throttle to full afterburner (AB) power. EnableDirectThrottleInput
   must be called to allow this control.

.. method:: void ReleaseDirectThrottleInput()

   This releases direct throttle input, re-establishing autopilot control of the throttle.

.. method:: void EnableDirectSpeedBrakeInput()

   This allows direct speed brake input, overriding any autopilot control of the speed brake.

.. method:: void OpenSpeedBrake()

   Sets the speed brake to the fully open position. EnableDirectSpeedBrakeInput must be
   called to allow this control.

.. method:: void CloseSpeedBrake()

   Sets the speed brake to the fully closed position. EnableDirectSpeedBrakeInput must
   be called to allow this control.

.. method:: void ReleaseDirectSpeedBrakeInput()

   This releases direct speed brake input, re-establishing autopilot control of the
   speed brake.

.. method:: double GetSpeedBrakePosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the speed brake(s). Zero is retracted and a positive value
   is extended.

.. method:: void SetFlapsPosition(double aPosition)

   Sets the flaps position. Valid values for aPosition are [0,1] -- 0 is retracted and 
   1 is fully extended. If there are no flaps on the P6DOF model, this function does nothing.

.. method:: double GetFlapsPosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the flaps. A positive value is trailing edge down.

.. method:: void SetSpoilersPosition(double aPosition)

   Sets the spoilers position. Valid values for aPosition are [0,1] -- 0 is retracted and
   1 is fully extended. If there are no spoilers on the P6DOF model, this function does nothing.

.. method:: double GetSpoilersPosition()

   Returns the angle (deg) of the spoilers. Zero is retracted and a positive value is extended.

These provide the flight control inputs.

.. method:: double GetStickRightPosition()
