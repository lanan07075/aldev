Creation
========

To create :class:`WsfFormation` objects, use one of the methods provided by
:class:`WsfFormationManager`.

Name Methods
============

.. method:: string GetQualifiedName()

   Returns the qualified name of this formation. The qualified
   name is unique among all the defined formations. The qualified
   name is composed from the relative names of this formation and all of
   its parent formations. For example, if the relative name of a formation
   is 'beta' and it is a sub-formation of a formation with relative name
   'red', then the qualified name of that formation would be 'red.beta'.

.. method:: string GetRelativeName()

   Return the relative name of this formation. The relative name is used to
   distinguish between the sub-formations of a formation, and does not need
   to be unique among all of the defined formations. Instead, it only needs to
   be unique among the sub-formations of its parent.

.. method:: bool Rename(string aNewName)

   Change the relative name of this formation. If successful, this will change
   the name of this formation as well as updating the qualified names of all 
   of the sub-formations of this formation, and this method will return true.
   If there proposed name change creates a conflict in the set of qualified 
   names, this method will do nothing and return false.

Structure Related Methods
=========================

.. method:: WsfFormation GetParentFormation()

   Get the parent formation of this formation. This will return an invalid
   object if this has no parent.

.. method:: bool IsRoot()

   Returns true if this formation is a top-level formation (if this formation
   has no parent).

.. method:: int GetNumSubFormations()

   Returns the number of sub-formations of this formation.

.. method:: WsfFormation GetSubFormation(string aRelativeName)

   Returns the sub-formation of this formation with the given relative name.
   If there is no such formation, this will return an invalid object.

.. method:: Array<WsfFormation> GetAllSubFormations()

   Returns an array of all of the sub-formations of this formation. If there
   are no sub-formations, this will return an empty array.

.. method:: bool IsLeaf()

   Returns true if this formation is a leaf (has no sub-formations).

.. method:: bool AddSubFormation(WsfFormation aFormation, WsfFormationOffset aOffset)

   Add the given formation as a sub-formation of this formation with the given
   offset. This method will return true if the addition was successful, and
   false otherwise. Reasons that this method might fail include: the input
   formation being invalid, the input formation already having a parent 
   formation, and this formation already having a sub-formation with the same
   relative name as the input formation.

   After the addition, the given formation will be a sub-formation of this
   formation and will have had its and all its descendants qualified names 
   updated to indicate the new ancestor.

.. method:: WsfFormation RemoveSubFormation(string aRelativeName)

   Remove the sub-formation of this formation with the given relative name.
   The removed sub-formation will have its parent reset, making it a top-level
   formation, as well as having its and all its descendants' qualified names 
   updated. Note that this does not disband the formation, it merely removes
   it as a sub-formation of this formation. If this removal is successful, this
   will return true.

Leader Related Methods
======================

.. method:: WsfFormation GetLeadSubFormation()

   Return the lead sub-formation of this formation. If there is no lead
   formation specified, this will return an invalid object.

.. method:: WsfFormation GetFormationLeader()

   Return the overall formation leader of this formation. This is distinct from
   :method:`WsfFormation.GetLeadSubFormation` in that this will continue down 
   to a leaf formation, following the lead each time.

.. method:: bool HasLeader()

   Returns true if this formation has a leader assigned. If this is true,
   then :method:`WsfFormation.GetLeadSubFormation` will return a valid object.

.. method:: bool IsLeader()

   Returns true if this formation is the lead formation of its parent formation.
   If there is no parent formation, this will always return false.

.. method:: bool SetLeader(string aRelativeName)

   Set the lead sub-formation of this formation to be the sub-formation with
   the given relative name, and return true. If there is no such formation,
   then this will return false.

Member Related Methods
======================

.. method:: int GetNumMemberPlatforms()

   Get the number of member platforms in all formations descendant from this
   formation.

.. method:: WsfPlatform GetMemberPlatform()

   Return the platform member of this formation. If this is not a unit
   formation this will return an invalid object.

.. method:: bool HasMemberPlatform()

   Return if this formation has a member platform assigned to it. This method
   could return false because the formation type does not support setting a 
   member, or because the formation type does, but a member is not assigned.

.. method:: bool SetMember(string aPlatformName)

   Set the member of this formation to be the platform with the given name.
   This will return false if the formation type does not support setting a
   member platform.

.. method:: bool SetMember(WsfPlatform aPlatform)

   Set the member of this formation to be the given platform. If the formation
   type does not support setting a member platform, this will return false.

Offset Related Methods
======================

.. method:: WsfOffset GetOffset()

   Return the offset of this formation relative to the parent formation.

   .. note:: One cannot set the offset directly using this object. Instead,
             one must use a command, :class:`WsfFormationChangeOffsetCommand`.

Command Related Methods
=======================

.. method:: bool IsAttached()

   Return if this formation is attached to its parent. A formation that is
   attached is subject to commands forwarded from its parent. Further, attached
   sub-formations will move to form up with the other members of its formation
   and will keep station in that formation.

.. method:: WsfFormationCommand GetCurrentCommand()

   Get the current command assigned to this formation. If there is no such 
   command, this will return an invalid object.

.. method:: bool ExecuteCommand(WsfFormationCommand aCommand)

   Execute the given command. This will assign the given command to this
   formation, forward transformed versions of this command to the 
   attached sub-formations or both. If the command is assigned to this formation, this
   will return true. If not, including the case where the command is forwarded,
   this will return false.

.. method:: bool ExecuteCommand(WsfFormationCommand aCommand, WsfFormationCommandConstraint aConstraint)

   Execute the given command with the given constraint. This will either assign
   this command to this formation, in which case this method will return true,
   or transformed versions of this command will be forwarded to the attached
   sub-formations of this formation, in which case this method will return
   false.
