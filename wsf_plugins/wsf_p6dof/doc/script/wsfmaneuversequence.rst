WsfManeuverSequence
-------------------

.. class:: WsfManeuverSequence inherits WsfManeuver

Overview
========

A :class:`WsfManeuverSequence` is a set of maneuvers that are executed in 
order. The elements of the sequence can be anything derived from
:class:`WsfManeuver` including another :class:`WsfManeuverSequence`. In 
addition to the individual members of the sequence each can have their own
entry and exit constraints (see :class:`WsfManeuver` and 
:class:`WsfManeuverConstraint`) the sequence as a whole can have entry and
exit constraints. A :class:`WsfManeuverSequence` can be set to looping so
that once the final maneuver of the sequence completes, the first will then
begin execution again.

Methods
=======

The :class:`WsfManeuverSequence` defines the following methods in addition to
those it inherits from :class:`WsfManeuver`.

.. method:: WsfManeuverSequence Construct()

   Returns a new instance of a maneuver sequence.

.. method:: bool IsLoop()

   Returns true if the sequence is a loop.

.. method:: void SetLoop(bool aLoop)

   Enable or disable looping on this maneuver sequence.
   In the looping mode, the constraints on the member maneuvers will be
   evaluated each time the maneuver is current, but the overall sequence
   constraints will be evaluated only once. Further, unless the loop is
   canceled or if :method:`WsfManeuverSequence.SetLoop` is called again to
   stop the loop, the exit constraint will never evaluate.

.. method:: void Clear()

   Clear the maneuver sequence.

.. method:: void Append(WsfManeuver aManeuver)

   Append the given maneuver to the end of this sequence.

.. method:: void InsertNext(WsfManeuver aManeuver)

   Insert the given maneuver after the current maneuver. If there is no
   current maneuver, the given maneuver will be appended to the sequence.

.. method:: WsfManeuver GetCurrentManeuver()

   Returns the currently executing maneuver in the sequence. If there is
   not current maneuver, this will return an invalid object.
