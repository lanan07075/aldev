WsfRelativeManeuver
-------------------

.. class:: WsfRelativeManeuver inherits WsfManeuver

Overview
========

A relative maneuver is any maneuver that will control the executing platform
in a way that refers to another platform in the simulation. Like other kinds of
maneuvers, a relative maneuver supports entry constraints so the start of a
relative maneuver can be made dependent on any available condition provided by
:class:`WsfManeuverConstraint`. Unlike other kinds of maneuvers, a relative
maneuver does not support exit constraints. Instead, a
relative maneuver continues to execute, trying to achieve the desired relationship
with respect to the target platform. In general the target platform will be
changing its state, and so the controls enacted by this maneuver must
continually update so that the executing platform can achieve its goal. To end
a relative maneuver, the maneuver must be explicitly canceled, or replaced
by another maneuver.

Users can control the aggressiveness of the relative maneuver by setting limits
on the g-load and speed that the relative maneuver will command. These limits
are distinct from those defined in the autopilot for the :class:`WsfP6DOF_Mover`
that is executing this maneuver.

Methods
=======

.. method:: double GetG_LoadMax()

   Return the maximum g-load that this maneuver will command for the executing
   platform. The default value of this limit is effectively infinite.

.. method:: void SetG_LoadMax(double aG_LoadMax)

   Set the maximum g-load that this maneuver will command for the executing
   platform.

.. method:: double GetG_LoadMin()

   Return the minimum g-load that this maneuver will command for the executing
   platform. The default value of this limit is effectively negative infinity.

.. method:: void SetG_LoadMin(double aG_LoadMin)

   Set the minimum g-load that this maneuver will command for the executing
   platform.

.. method:: double GetSpeedKTAS_Max()

   Return the maximum speed (as knots true airspeed) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform. The default value of this limit is
   effectively infinite.

.. method:: void SetSpeedKTAS_Max(double aSpeedKTAS_Max)

   Set the maximum speed (as knots true airspeed) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform.

.. method:: double GetSpeedKTAS_Min()

   Return the minimum speed (as knots true airspeed) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform. The default value of this limit is zero.

.. method:: void SetSpeedKTAS_Min(double aSpeedKTAS_Min)

   Set the minimum speed (as knots true airspeed) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform.

.. method:: double GetSpeedMpsMax()

   Return the maximum speed (in meters per second) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform. The default value of this limit is
   effectively infinite.

.. method:: void SetSpeedMpsMax(double aSpeedMpsMax)

   Set the maximum speed (in meters per second) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform.

.. method:: double GetSpeedMpsMin()

   Return the minimum speed (in meters per second) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform. The default value of this limit is zero.

.. method:: void SetSpeedMpsMin(double aSpeedMpsMin)

   Set the minimum speed (in meters per second) that this maneuver will
   command for the executing platform.
