WsfRollDeltaManeuver
--------------------

.. class:: WsfRollDeltaManeuver inherits WsfManeuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets a target change in roll angle for the platform to which it
is assigned. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target is set, so if 
there is a need to wait for the achieved change in roll angle, a
:class:`WsfManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfRollDeltaManeuver Construct(double aRollDeltaDeg)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target change in roll angle for the
   platform to which the maneuver is assigned.

.. method:: double GetRollDelta()

   Return this maneuver's target change in roll angle.
