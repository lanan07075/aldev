WsfP6DOF_Fuel
-------------

.. class:: WsfP6DOF_Fuel inherits WsfFuel

Like :model:`WSF_FUEL`, :model:`WSF_P6DOF_FUEL` encapsulates the ability to make queries regarding fuel status. In addition to the methods provided in :class:`WsfP6DOF_Mover`, this provides common fuel-related methods derived from the :model:`WSF_FUEL` class.

Methods
=======

.. method:: bool Refuel()
            bool Refuel(double aAmount)

   Refuels the platform to its maximum fuel capacity.  Returns 'true' if successful.

.. method:: double QuantityRemaining()

   Returns the quantity of fuel in kg remaining on the platform.

.. method:: double QuantityRequired(double aDistance)
            double QuantityRequired(double aDistance, double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the quantity of fuel in kg required to travel the given distance. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used.

.. method:: double QuantityRequired(WsfRoute aRoute)

   Returns the quantity of fuel in kg required to travel the given route. The altitude and speed of each waypoint in the route are used in the calculation.

.. method:: void SetQuantityRemaining(double aQuantityRemaining)

   Sets the remaining fuel quantity to the specified value (kg).

.. method:: double ConsumptionRate()
            double ConsumptionRate(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the platform's fuel consumption rate (kg/sec). If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used.

.. method:: void SetConsumptionRate(double aConsumptionRate)

   Sets the fuel consumption rate to the specified value (kg/sec).

.. warning:: This method should only be used with the fixed consumption rate fuel model (i.e., not with P6DOF movers).

.. method:: double MaximumQuantity()

   Returns the maximum fuel quantity (kg).

.. method:: double InitialQuantity()

   Returns the initial fuel quantity (kg).

.. method:: void SetInitialQuantity(double aInitialQuantity)

   Sets the initial fuel quantity to the specified value (kg).

.. method:: double BingoQuantity()

   Returns the bingo fuel quantity (kg).

.. method:: void SetBingoQuantity(double aBingoQuantity)

   Sets the bingo fuel quantity to the specified value (kg).

.. method:: double ReserveQuantity()

   Returns the reserve fuel quantity (kg).

.. method:: void SetReserveQuantity(double aReserveQuantity)

   Sets the reserve fuel quantity to the specified value (kg).

.. method:: double TimeAtBingo()
            double TimeAtBingo(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the time in seconds that the platform can travel after BINGO. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double TimeAtReserve()
            double TimeAtReserve(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the time in seconds that the platform can travel after reserve limit. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double TimeToBingo()
            double TimeToBingo(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the time in seconds until the platform will declare BINGO. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double TimeToEmpty()
            double TimeToEmpty(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the time in seconds until the platform is completely out of fuel. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double TimeToReserve()
            double TimeToReserve(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the time in seconds until the platform reaches its fuel reserve limit. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double DistanceAtBingo()
            double DistanceAtBingo(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the distance in meters that the platform can travel after BINGO. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double DistanceAtReserve()
            double DistanceAtReserve(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the distance in meters that the platform can travel after reserve limit. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double DistanceToBingo()
            double DistanceToBingo(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the distance in meters until the platform will declare BINGO. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double DistanceToReserve()
            double DistanceToReserve(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the distance in meters until the platform reaches its fuel reserve limit. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.

.. method:: double DistanceToEmpty()
            double DistanceToEmpty(double aAltitude, double aSpeed)

   Returns the distance in meters until the platform is completely out of fuel. If no altitude and speed are provided, the platform's current altitude and speed are used. P6DOF movers do not support the altitude and speed parameters and use the current altitude and speed for both methods.
