WsfFormationRemoveSubCommand
----------------------------

.. class:: WsfFormationRemoveSubCommand inherits WsfFormationCommand

:class:`WsfFormationRemoveSubCommand` is a command that will remove a 
sub-formation from the formation to which it is assigned. This will remove
the sub-formation, but not destroy it. Instead, the removed formation will
now appear as a top-level formation. The members of the removed formation 
will have their station keeping updated to reflect the change in organization.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfFormationRemoveSubCommand Construct(string aRelativeName)

   Construct a command that will remove the sub-formation with the given
   relative name from the formation to which this command is assigned.

   This provided relative name does not have to indicate a direct sub-formation
   of the formation to which this command is assigned. For example, removing
   'alpha.two' from the 'yankee' formation has the same effect as removing
   'two' from the 'yankee.alpha' formation.

.. method:: string GetFormationToRemove()

   Return the relative name of the sub-formation that will be removed from the
   formation to which this command is assigned.
