Overview
========

A unit formation can have no sub-formations, but are where the member platforms
of a formation hierarchy are specified. Unit formations cannot be defined at 
the root level in input files, and cannot have subformations. Units can also
be defined in script, see :class:`WsfFormation` and
:class:`WsfFormationManager`. Units can be given commands, see
:class:`WsfFormationCommand`.
