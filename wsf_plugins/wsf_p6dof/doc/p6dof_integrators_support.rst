.. _P6DOF_Integrators_Support:

P6DOF Integrators Support
=========================

P6DOF was designed with the ability to use different numerical integration approaches. These different integrators are "loaded" through the use of the p6dof_integrators_ command.

At the current time, only a single (default) integrator is provided, but software developers can derive from the base class (P6DofIntegrator) to introduce other integrators.

.. command:: p6dof_integrators <filename>

   This will load one or more P6DOF integrators by reading/loading the specified file.
   
   See :ref:`P6DOF_Integrators_File_Definition` for the definition of the integrators file format.
   
The p6dof_integrators_ line can be defined independently, but is often grouped into a another file (typically p6dof_environment.txt) along with the :ref:`P6DOF_Environment_Support` items.
