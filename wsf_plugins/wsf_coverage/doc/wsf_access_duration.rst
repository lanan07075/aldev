Overview
========

:model:`WSF_ACCESS_DURATION_MOE` computes quantities related to the durations of access
intervals of individual free assets. This measure operates on the intervals during which
there is coverage from free assets individually rather than coverage from any free
asset. As a result, coverage from two different free assets whose access intervals
overlap in time will not be counted as one long access interval, but rather two separate
intervals, one for each free asset. If such an interval straddles the boundary of the
coverage interval, the interval is truncated to begin (or end) when the coverage interval
begins (or ends).

Computation Subtype
===================

.. command:: subtype <sub-type> [<parameter>]

   Specify the computation subtype. 

   :model:`WSF_ACCESS_DURATION_MOE` has the following subtypes that take no parameter:

   * **minimum** - The measured value will be the minimum access interval duration for the grid point in question.
   * **maximum** - The measured value will be the maximum access interval duration for the grid point in question.
   * **mean** - The measured value will be the mean access interval duration for the grid point in question.
   * **standard_deviation** - The measured value will be the standard deviation of the access interval durations for the grid point in question.
   * **sum** - The measured value will be the sum of the access interval durations for the grid point in question. Note that if access intervals overlap, then this may be longer than the duration of the whole coverage interval.

   :model:`WSF_ACCESS_DURATION_MOE` supports the following subtype that takes an
   input parameter specifying a percentage value, which must be greater than 0
   and less than 100.

   * **percent_above** - For <parameter> percent of the coverage interval, the grid point in question is experiencing an access interval with a duration greater than or equal to the computed value.
