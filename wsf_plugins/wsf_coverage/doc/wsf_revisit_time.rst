Overview
========

:model:`WSF_REVISIT_TIME_MOE` computes quantities related to the revisit time of
a grid point. This measure operates on gaps, which are intervals during which
the grid point has no access to any of the free assets. If such a gap straddles
the boundary of the coverage interval, the gap is truncated to begin (or end)
when the coverage interval begins (or ends).

Computation Subtype
===================

.. command:: subtype <sub-type> [<parameter>]

   Specify the computation subtype. :model:`WSF_REVISIT_TIME_MOE` has the
   following subtypes that take no parameter:

   * **minimum** - The measured value will be the minimum gap duration for the grid point in question.
   * **maximum** - The measured value will be the maximum gap duration for the grid point in question.
   * **mean** - The measured value will be the mean gap duration for the grid point in question.
   * **standard_deviation** - The measured value will be the standard deviation of the gap durations for the grid point in question.

   :model:`WSF_REVISIT_TIME_MOE` supports the following subtypes that take an
   input parameter specifying a percentage value, which must be greater than 0
   and less than 100.

   * **number_percent_below** - For the grid point in question, <parameter> percent of the gaps have a duration shorter than the computed value.
   * **percent_below** - For <parameter> percent of the coverage interval, the grid point in question has a revisit time less than the computed value.
   * **percent_below_gaps_only** - For <parameter> percent of the time while in a coverage gap, the grid point in question has a revisit time less than the computed value.
