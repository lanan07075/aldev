Overview
========

:model:`WSF_TIME_AVERAGE_GAP_MOE` computes the average length of a coverage gap in seconds that
one would find if the :command:`coverage interval <coverage.start_time>` were randomly sampled. This measure operates
on gaps, which are intervals during which the grid point has no access to any of the
free assets. The result is equal to :math:`\frac{\sum(CoverageGapDuration^2)}{CoverageIntervalDuration}`.
