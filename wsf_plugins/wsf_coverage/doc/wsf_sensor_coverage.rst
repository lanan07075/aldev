Overview
========

Sensor coverage monitors sensor interactions between the specified grid and
free assets. Relevant devices for sensor coverage are any sensors. Further,
only one asset in each grid asset-free asset pair needs to have a device
specified; the other asset should use 'none' as the device name.
