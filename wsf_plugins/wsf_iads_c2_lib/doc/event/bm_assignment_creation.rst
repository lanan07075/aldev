 <time> <event> <assigned platform name> <target platform name> (<target platform side>) <assigning platform name> (<assigning platform side>) TrackId: <track id>
  Start_Time: <start time> <assign type>
  Truth: LLA: <lat> <lon> <alt>
  Sensor_Type: <sensor type> Weapon_Type: <weapon>
 Source_TrackId: <source track id> <shot doctrine>
