WsfBMAssignmentMessage
----------------------

.. class:: WsfBMAssignmentMessage

**WsfBMAssignmentMessage** is the script interface for the battle
manager assignment messages.


Methods
=======

.. method:: void SetAssignmentTime(double time_seconds)

   Sets the time of the assignment in seconds since the simulation start.

.. method:: double GetAssignmentTime()

   Returns the time of the assignment in seconds since the simulation start.

.. method:: void SetAssignedID(int assigned_platform_id, int assigned_weapon_index)

   Sets the assigned weapon within the assignment message.

   **Parameters**

      **int assigned_platform_id:** Platform id of the assigned asset.

      **int weapon_idx:** Weapon index(0-based) of the
      :class:`WsfWeapon` on the reported platform for
      this assignment.

.. method:: int GetAssignedUnitID()

   Returns the Platform id of the assigned asset from the call to
   `SetAssignedID <#WsfBMAssignmentMessage.SetAssignedID>`__.

.. method:: int GetAssignedWeaponID()

   Returns the Weapon index(0-based) of the
   :class:`WsfWeapon` on the reported platform for this assignment.

.. method:: void SetTrackID(int reporting_platform_idx, int tan)

   Sets the track for the assignment.

   **Parameters**

      **int reporting_platform_idx:** Reporting Platform Index.

      **int tan:** Track number.


.. method:: int GetTrackingSystemID()

   Gets the reporting_platform_idx set within the [SetTrackID]{#SetTrackID} call.

.. method:: int GetTrackID()

   Gets the tan set within the [SetTrackID]{#SetTrackID} call.

.. method:: WsfTrackId GetTrackID()

   Gets the :class:`WsfTrackId` of the assignment track.

.. method:: void SetInitiatingID(int assignment_initiator_platform_id)

   Sets the platform id of the assignment initiator. In the case of a delegate
   assignment, this will be the original assigning platform id.

.. method:: int GetInitiatingUnitID()

   Returns the platform id of the assignment initiator. In the case of a
   delegate assignment, this will be the original assigning platform id.

.. method:: void SetAssigningID(int assigning_platform_id)

   Sets the platform id of the assigning platform id. For commit (non-delegate)
   assignments, this will be the same as the initiating platform id.

.. method:: int GetAssigningUnitID()

   Returns the platform id of the assigning platform id. For commit (non-delegate)
   assignments, this will be the same as the initiating platform id.

.. method:: void SetSelfDefenseFlag(bool is_self_defense_assignment)

   Sets whether the assignment is a self-defense assignment if true, otherwise, a
   commanded assignment if false. This is for use between a weapons manager and a
   weapon, but if a self defense assignment is made at a lower level, this will need
   to be recorded in the assignment status  report as well.

.. method:: bool GetSelfDefenseFlag()

   Returns whether the assignment is a self-defense assignment if true, otherwise,
   a commanded assignment if false. This is for use between a weapons manager and a
   weapon, but if a self defense assignment is made at a lower level, this will need
   to be recorded in the assignment status report as well.

.. method:: void SetMaxFiringTime(double max_time_seconds)

   Sets the max time allowed for the assignment prosecution.

.. method:: double GetMaxFiringTime()

   Returns the max time allowed for the assignment prosecution.

.. method:: void SetAssignmentReasonNewAssignment()

   Sets the reason for the assignment message because it is a new assignment.

.. method:: void SetAssignmentReasonRetransmit()

   Sets the reason for the assignment message because it is a retransmit.

.. method:: void SetAssignmentReasonUpdate()

   Sets the reason for the assignment message because it is an update to an
   existing assignment.

.. method:: void SetAssignmentReasonReassignment()

   Sets the reason for the assignment message because it is a reassignment.

.. method:: void SetAssignmentReasonCancel()

   Sets the reason for the assignment message because it is a cancellation
   to an existing assignment.

.. method:: void IsAssignmentReasonNewAssignment()

   Returns true if the assignment reason was set with
   `SetAssignmentReasonNewAssignment <#WsfBMAssignmentMessage.SetAssignmentReasonNewAssignment>`__ ,
   otherwise false.

.. method:: void IsAssignmentReasonRetransmit()

   Returns true if the assignment reason was set with
   `IsAssignmentReasonRetransmit <#WsfBMAssignmentMessage.IsAssignmentReasonRetransmit>`__,
   otherwise false.

.. method:: void IsAssignmentReasonUpdate()

   Returns true if the assignment reason was set with
   `IsAssignmentReasonUpdate <#WsfBMAssignmentMessage.IsAssignmentReasonUpdate>`__, otherwise false.

.. method:: void IsAssignmentReasonReassignment()

   Returns true if the assignment reason was set with
   `IsAssignmentReasonReassignment <#WsfBMAssignmentMessage.IsAssignmentReasonReassignment>`__,
   otherwise false.

.. method:: void IsAssignmentReasonCancel()

   Returns true if the assignment reason was set with
   `IsAssignmentReasonCancel <#WsfBMAssignmentMessage.IsAssignmentReasonCancel>`__, otherwise
   false.

.. method:: string GetAssignmentReasonString()

   Convenience function for returning a string version of the assignment
   reason for debugging or logging purposes.

.. method:: void SetShotDoctrineS1()

   Sets the shot doctrine for the assignment to Shoot-1.

.. method:: void SetShotDoctrineS2()

   Sets the shot doctrine for the assignment to Shoot-2.

.. method:: void SetShotDoctrineSLS()

   Sets the shot doctrine for the assignment to Shoot-Look-Shoot.

.. method:: bool IsShotDoctrineS1()

   Returns true if the shot doctrine for the assignment is Shoot-1.

.. method:: bool IsShotDoctrineS2()

   Returns true if the shot doctrine for the assignment is Shoot-2.

.. method:: bool IsShotDoctrineSLS()

   Returns true if the shot doctrine for the assignment is
   Shoot-Look-Shoot.

.. method:: string GetShotDoctrineString()

   Convenience function for returning a string version of the shot
   doctrine for debugging or logging purposes.

.. method:: void SetTransmittedFlag()

   Sets the assignment as having been transmitted.
   
   **Primarily a Disseminate C^2 Interface**

.. method:: bool GetTransmittedFlag()

   Returns true if the assignment has been marked as transmitted, otherwise false.

.. method:: void Print()

   Logs the assignment message to the log output stream.
