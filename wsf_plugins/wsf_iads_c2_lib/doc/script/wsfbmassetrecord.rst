WsfBMAssetRecord
----------------

.. class:: WsfBMAssetRecord
   :cloneable:
   :constructible:

**WsfBMAssetRecord** is the script interface for the battle manager's
friendly asset perception. This structure is used primarily for IADS
initialization within the battle manager models.


Methods
=======

.. method:: void InitNode(int platform_index, string name, string side)

   Initializes the record with the platform index, platform name, and side string.

   **Parameters**

      **int platform_index:** Platform id of the referenced asset.

      **string name:** Platform name of the referenced asset.

      **string side:** Team string. Only used for logging purposes.
      All assets assumed same-side as receiving battle manager.

.. method:: void AddDirectSubordinate(int platform_index, WsfBMAssetMap asset_map)

   Adds the asset record referenced by the platform id as a direct subordinate to this asset within the asset_map.

   **Parameters**

      **int platform_index:** Platform id of the referenced asset.

      **WsfBMAssetMap asset_map:** Asset Map from battle manager.

.. method:: void AddPeer(int platform_index, WsfBMAssetMap asset_map)

   Adds the asset record referenced by the platform id as a peer to this asset within the asset_map.

   **Parameters**      

      **int platform_index:** Platform id of the referenced asset.

      **WsfBMAssetMap asset_map:** Asset Map from battle manager.

.. method:: void AddDirectCommander(int platform_index, WsfBMAssetMap asset_map)

   Adds the asset record referenced by the platform id as the direct commander to this asset within the asset_map.

   **Parameters**

      **int platform_index:** Platform id of the referenced asset.

      **WsfBMAssetMap asset_map:** Asset Map from battle manager.

.. method:: void AddWeaponInfo(WsfBMWeaponInterface weapon_info)

   Adds the weapon information to this asset(for weapon platforms)

   **Parameters**

      **WsfBMWeaponInterface weapon_info:** Weapon info to add to the asset record.

.. method:: void SetLocationECEF(double ecef_x_meters, double ecef_y_meters, double ecef_z_meters)

   Sets the location of the asset in WCS meters.

.. method:: void SetVelocityECEF(double ecef_vx_ms, double ecef_vy_ms, double ecef_vz_ms)

   Sets the velocity of the asset in WCS meters/second.

.. method:: void AttachDA(WsfZone zone, double priority)

   Adds zone as a defended area to the asset. This will make the asset a defended
   asset and carries special meaning to certain battle managers. Note that DA's are
   the only zone type that can be attached at the asset (platform) level.
   Weapon-zones such as missile, fighter, or other engagement zone types must be
   added at the weapon-level on the asset.

    **Parameters**

       **WsfZone zone:** Zone definition of the defended area.

       **double priority:** Zone priority 1.0 being the highest priority
       and lesser priorities higher.

.. method:: void SetMaxPlatformAssignments(int max_assignments)

   Sets the max assignments for the asset.

.. method:: void SetCurrPlatformAssignments(int num_assignments)

   Sets the current assignments for the asset. This is done only at
   initialization time and future asset perception continues to set
   this going forward.

.. method:: void SetPlatformAssignmentDelay(int delay_seconds)

   Sets the assignment delay for the asset.

.. method:: void SetSystemStatusRed()

   Sets the asset status as red(down).

.. method:: void SetSystemStatusGreen()

   Sets the asset status as green(normal).

.. method:: void SetSystemStatusWhite()

   Sets the asset status as white(out of munitions).

   **Note:** An asset that is out of munitions is not required to be set white, this
   will be inferred by the battle managers. Setting the status to white is simply
   a convention for logging.

.. method:: int GetID()

   Gets the platform id associated with this asset record.

.. method:: void SetC2Capable(bool c2_capable_flag)

   Sets asset as C^2 capable if the flag is true, otherwise false.

   **Note:** An asset that is marked as C^2 capable has special meaning to both the
   battle manager and C^2 dissemination models. Generally, these are considered
   intermediate C^2 units for the purposes of the IADS chain of command.

.. method:: bool GetC2Capable()

   Returns true if the asset was marked as C^2 capable via a call to
   `SetC2Capable <#WsfBMAssetRecord.SetC2Capable>`__, otherwise false.

.. method:: void SetDefaultDefendedPriority(double priority)

   Sets the default defended asset priority for the case that this is a
   battle manager asset but no defended zones are attached.
