Overview
========

:model:`WSF_WEAPONS_MANAGER` is a script base class for the HELIOS-based
Weapons Manager models to inherit from. It is not meant to be used as a
processor in its own right, instead, Weapons Manager models use it to
provide common scripting functionality found in all weapons manager
processors.

Script Interface
================

:model:`WSF_WEAPONS_MANAGER` utilizes capabilities of the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface` and :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`.

Weapons Manager Commands
========================

.. command:: haveco_reporting_strategy [on_launch | on_detonate | on_kill] 

   Specifies when to assess an engagement in order to report HAVCO success or failure. On_launch behavior will cause assignments to be considered complete while missiles are still in flight, and therefore may cause multiple unnecessary assignments and shots against a target.
   
   **Default:** on_kill
