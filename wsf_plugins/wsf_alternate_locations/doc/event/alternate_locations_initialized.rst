ALTERNATE_LOCATIONS_INITIALIZED
-------------------------------

When an Alternate Locations component initializes the location of an owning platform, this event output will print the relevant information.

Format
======

::

 <time> <event> <platform> Type: <alternate locations type> Draw: <random draw> Sum-Of-Weights: <sum of weights> Location-Index: <location index>
  Reference: <base platform> Location-<location index> <base location>
  Offset ARA Angle: <offset angle> Radius: <offset radius> Altitude: <offset altitude> Heading: <heading>
  Offset LLA: <offset latitude> <offset longitude> <offset altitude> Heading: <heading>
  <location>

Breakdown
=========

<time>
    current simulation time
<event>
    simulation event that occurred
<platform>
    name of the platform being initialized via alternate locations
<alternate locations type>
    "Local"  a location was individually randomized from the listed locations in the platform's alternate_locations block
    "Global"  a location was randomized using a global random draw from the listed locations in the platform's alternate_locations block
    "Reference"  a location was selected to match the index of the location selected for the corresponding base platform
    "Offset"  a location was generated by applying an offset to the location selected for the corresponding base platform
<random draw>
    if the alternate locations type is "Local" or "Global", the random draw that was used to select the platform's location
<sum of weights>
    if the alternate locations type is "Local" or "Global", the sum of the weights of all potential locations in the platform's alternate locations block
<location index>
    if the alternate locations type is "Local", "Global", or "Reference", the 1-based index of the platform's selected location
<base platform>
    name of the platform which is being used as the reference for index ("Reference") or location ("Offset")
<base location>
    the reference platform's selected location
<offset angle>
    the angle from due north of the great-circle-arc offset applied to the base location
<offset radius>
    the length of the great-circle-arc offset applied to the base location
<offset altitude>
    the length of the altitude offset applied to the base location
<offset latitude>
    the latitude offset applied to the base location
<offset longitude>
    the longitude offset applied to the base location
<location>
    the location initialized to the platform via Alternate Locations
<heading>
    the heading initialized to the platform via Alternate Locations
