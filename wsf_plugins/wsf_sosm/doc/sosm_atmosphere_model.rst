SOSM_atmosphere_model
---------------------

.. model:: atmosphere_model SOSM_atmosphere_model

This page describes how to create an SOSM atmosphere definition using the table model.

Creating the atmosphere definition consists of three step:

* Acquire raw spectral atmospheric data. This is generally accomplished by executing MODTRAN. (See `Executing
  MODTRAN`_)
* Convert raw spectral atmospheric data from the first step to a format that can be read by the SOSM. (See
  `Converting MODTRAN Output`_)
* Create a the SOSM atmophere model file that references the files created in the second step. (See `Creating the
  Atmosphere Definition File`_)

A pair of Perl scripts are provided with the WSF release which facilitate the use of MODTRAN in preparing the
atmosphere tables needed by the model. These scripts are located in *sosm/modtran* and operate as follows:

Executing MODTRAN
=================

A Perl script 'modtran_execute.pl' is included with the standard WSF distribution in the directory *sosm/modtran*.
This script facilitates the creation of the raw spectral atmospheric data using MODTRAN over the desired altitude,
elevation and range values. Execute the script as follows::

 *<path-to-wsf>*/sosm/modtran/modtran_execute.pl *<basename>*

The file '*<basename>*.def' which indicates the observer altitudes, the line of sight elevation angle and range values
and the MODTRAN input cards. The preparation of a '.def' file requires some knowledge of MODTRAN. Several examples of
'.def' files are present in the *sosm/modtran* directory. The output from this script are the files::

 *<basename>*_bgr.plt - Background radiance
 *<basename>*_bgt.plt - Background transmittance *(Not currently used)*
 *<basename>*_fgr.plt - Foreground radiance
 *<basename>*_fgt.plt - Foreground transmittance

Note that it can take several hours to perform this process.

The following observations should be noted when creating the MODTRAN input:

* Card 4, FLAGS(1:1) should be blank or 'W' (wavenumber input)
* Card 4, XFLAG must be set to 'W' (wavenumber output).
* Card 4, DV should be set to 20 (cm-1) unless you are also prepared to update your sensor and target models.
* Card 4, V1 and V2 should be a multiple of DV.
* The size of the output files will be directly proportional to the number of spectral samples, i.e.: ((V2 - V1) / DV)
  + 1.

Converting MODTRAN Output
=========================

Once MODTRAN has been run to create the necessary files, the files must be converted into tho format that can be used
by SOSM. This can be accomplished by using the Perl script *modtran_convert.pl* that is supplied with the standard
WSF distribution in the directory *sosm/modtran*. Execute the script as follows::

 modtran_convert.pl *<basename>*

The script takes the files produced by the previous step and produces the tables needed by SOSM::

 *<basename>*.bgr
 *<basename>*.bgt *(Not currently used)*
 *<basename>*.fgr
 *<basename>*.fgt

Creating the Atmosphere Definition File
=======================================

After running the previous steps, the file '*<basename>*.txt' should be created which contains the following::

 atmosphere_model table
    background_radiance      *<basename>*.bgr
    foreground_radiance      *<basename>*.fgr
    foreground_transmittance *<basename>*.fgt
 end_atmosphere

Example
=======

Assume you wish to create a new atmosphere type that is based on the US Standard Day atmosphere that is provided with
the standard WSF distribution. Copy 'sosm/modtran/us_std_day.def' to 'us_std_day_mod.def' and edit as desired. Then
execute MODTRAN::

 *<path-to-wsf>*/sosm/modtran/modtran_execute.pl us_std_day_mod

Convert the files::

 *<path-to-wsf>*/sosm/modtran/modtran_convert.pl us_std_day_mod

Create the file 'us_std_day_mod.txt' with the following contents::

 atmosphere_model table
    background_radiance      us_std_day_mod.bgr
    foreground_radiance      us_std_day_mod.fgr
    foreground_transmittance us_std_day_mod.fgt
 end_atmosphere

To use the new model in your simulation, add the following commands to your simulation input stream after all other
sosm_interface commands::

 sosm_interface
    sosm_interface.load_atmosphere     US_STD_DAY_MOD from us_std_day_mod.txt
    sosm_interface.default_atmosphere  US_STD_DAY_MOD
 end_sosm_interface
