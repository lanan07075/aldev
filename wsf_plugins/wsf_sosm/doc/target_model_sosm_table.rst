SOSM target model table
-----------------------

This page describes the process for creating a 'table' 'target_model' that can been loaded with the
:command:`sosm_interface load_target <sosm_interface.load_target>` command.

Creating the target model is a three step process:

* Acquire raw spectral infrared signature data. This is generally accomplished by using an infrared prediction model
  like IRIMAGE. (See `Executing IRIMAGE`_)

* Convert the raw spectral infrared signature data created in the first step to a format that can be read by SOSM. (See
  `Converting IRIMAGE 'kio3' Files`_)

* Create the SOSM target definition file that specifies how the signature files created in the second step are to be
  used during a simulation. (See `Creating the Target Definition File`_)

A pair of Perl scripts have been provided with the standard WSF distribution that assists in using IRIMAGE to
complete the first two steps.

Executing IRIMAGE
=================


IRIMAGE is typically run by an IR signature analyst. This process can take a great deal of time (days to weeks
depending on the number of cases desired). If you need to complete this step yourself then continue reading.

A Perl script *execute_irimage.pl* is included with the standard WSF distribution in the directory *sosm/irimage*.
This script facilitates executing IRIMAGE over a range of conditions. To execute the script:

 *<path-to-wsf>*/sosm/irimage/execute_irimage.pl *<basename>*

Where *<basename>* is the base name of the target type, and perhaps Mach number. For instance *su-35_m12* might be used
for a SU-35 at Mach 1.2.

This script takes two files:

*<basename>*.def
   Contains commands that define the mach number, altitudes and bands for which data will be generated.

*<basename>*.iri
   Contains the template of the IRIMAGE input needed to run this the mach number in question.

The script then invokes IRIMAGE for each altitude and band for the given mach number and produces a '.kio3' file for
each case.

The files 'su-35_m12.def' and 'su-35_m12.iri' are provided as examples in the *sosm/irimage* directory.

Converting IRIMAGE 'kio3' Files
===============================


Once IRIMAGE has been run to create the necessary 'kio3' files, the files must be converted into the format that can be
used by SOSM. This can be accomplished using the 'kio3_to_sosm.pl' script that is supplied with each WSF release in
the directory *sosm/irimage*.

The first thing that needs to be done is to create a file named 'kio3_to_sosm.txt' in the same directory that contains
the 'kio3' files. A template for this file in supplied with each WSF release in the directory *sosm/irimage*. After
copying the file, edit the copy and update the information as directed in the comments at the end of the file. In most
cases all that will need to be provided is security classification information in the third line.

After that is complete, execute the following command::

 *<path-to-wsf>*/sosm/irimage/kio3_to_sosm.pl *.kio3

This will take each file of the form::

 *<basename>*.kio3

and produce four files:
 *<basename>*.bda          Projected area of the body
 *<basename>*.bdi          Radiant intensity of the body
 *<basename>*.pla          Projected area of the plume
 *<basename>*.pli          Radiant intensity of the plume

These files should be copied the directory where the SOSM target definition will be created.

Creating the Target Definition File
===================================


The target definition file defines under what simulation conditions which signature files should be used. This can best
be documented by example, but first the commands will be documented.

Target Definition Commands
==========================

.. block:: _.target_model_sosm_table_commands

.. command:: target_model table ... end_target_model
   
   Introduces a target model definition that uses tables. **table** is required.

.. command:: state <state-name> ... end_state
   
   A *state* identifies a set of target conditions to which the associated signature applies. The altitude_range_,
   mach_range_, speed_range_ and throttle_range_ define the target conditions to which the state
   applies. The contained band_ blocks define the associated signature files.
   
   *<state-name>* is simply a user-definable name for the state. It has no other purpose other than to uniquely identify
   the state within the target definition.
   
   .. note::
      Every target definition must have at least one state.

   .. note::
      The order of state_ definitions is important. For each detection chance, the target conditions
      are used to select the appropriate state_. The list of states is searched in the order they are defined, and the
      first one that matches the target conditions is used. If no state matches the current target conditions, the last state
      defined is used.


.. command:: altitude_range <lower-length-value> <upper-length-value>
   
   Defines the range of altitudes for which the enclosing state_ applies.
    
   **Default** No limits - altitude is not a criteria

.. command:: mach_range <lower-mach> <upper-mach>
.. command:: speed_range <lower-speed-value> <upper-speed-value>
   
   Defines the range of speeds for which the enclosing state_ applies. The range can be defined in either terms of
   Mach number or absolute speed.

.. command:: throttle_range <lower-value> <upper-value>
   
   Defines the throttle range for which the enclosing state_ applies.

.. command:: band <band-name> ... end_band
   
   Every state_ must have one or more **band** blocks that define the signature files that apply to the specific
   bands. *<band-name>* is simply a user-definable string that identifies the band. The actual range of wavelengths to
   which the the enclosed files apply is determined by the file contents.
   
   Body area/intensity must be specified. Plume area/intensity is not required if a plume is not present.
   
   The signature files to be used can be loaded by the following commands:

.. command:: body_and_plume <base-name>
.. command:: body <base-name>
.. command:: plume <base-name>

   Load signature files using the assumed suffixes (.bda and .bdi for body, .pla and .pli for plume).
   
   * **body_and_plume** reads the signature files for both the body and the plume (*<base-name>*.bda, *<base-name>*.bdi,
     *<base-name>*.pla and *<base-name>*.pli).
   
   * **body** reads only the signature files for the body (*<base-name>*.bda and *<base-name>*.bdi).
   
   * **plume** reads only the signature files for the plume (*<base-name>*.pla and *<base-name>*.pli).

.. command:: body_area <file-name>
.. command:: body_intensity <file-name>
.. command:: plume_area <file-name>
.. command:: plume_intensity <file-name>
   
   Load signature files without using the assumed suffixes.

Example
^^^^^^^

Assume we are creating a definition for a new fighter call F-XX and that the first two steps have been executed for the
following conditions:

 * Two Mach numbers 0.8 and 1.2
 * Three altitudes, 30000 feet, 35000 feet and 40000 feet.
 * Two sensor bands, MWIR (3-5 um) and LWIR (8-12 um).

This will result in having 12 sets of files, which will be assumed to be named as follows::

 f-xx_30k_m08_lwir.*
 f-xx_30k_m08_mwir.*
 f-xx_30k_m12_lwir.*
 f-xx_30k_m12_mwir.*
 f-xx_35k_m08_lwir.*
 f-xx_35k_m08_mwir.*
 f-xx_35k_m12_lwir.*
 f-xx_35k_m12_mwir.*
 f-xx_40k_m08_lwir.*
 f-xx_40k_m08_mwir.*
 f-xx_40k_m12_lwir.*
 f-xx_40k_m12_mwir.*

Furthermore, assume a directory 'f-xx' has been created.

The target definition file *f-xx.txt* would then look like::
