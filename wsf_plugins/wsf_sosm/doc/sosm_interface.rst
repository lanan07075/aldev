Overview
========

The commands in sosm_interface control the interface between WSF and the Spectral Optical Sensing Model (SOSM). SOSM is a reasonably high-fidelity model suitable for analysis of infrared systems in a mission-level simulation environment. SOSM uses a spectral representation of sensors, targets and the atmosphere, allowing it to more realistically model the interactions between sensor and target.

The characteristics of the sensors, targets and atmosphere are maintained in separate files specific to SOSM. sosm_interface contains commands to load the definitions into SOSM and control the mapping of WSF sensor and target types to associated SOSM types. See :ref:`SOSM_Overview` for more information.

sosm_interface Commands
=======================

.. command:: show_status <boolean-value>

   Indicates if progress messages should be shown while loading files.

   **Default** false

.. command:: cache_directory <directory-name>

   Specifies the name of the directory to which cached binary files (produced as the result of enabling
   write_cache_files_) are to be written.

   **Default** ./sosm_cache

.. command:: ignore_cache_files <boolean-value>

   Indicates if the binary cache files created as a result of the write_cache_files_ or fast_detection_mode_
   commands should be used. If true, any cached files will be ignored and all data will be read from the original text
   files.

   **Default** false (cached binary files will be used if present)

   .. note::
      If 'ignore_cache_files true' is specified, 'write_cache_files false' will be assumed unless
      subsequently set to true. If you want to suppress reading the existing cache files and create new ones, you must first
      specify 'ignore_cache_files true' followed by 'write_cache_files true'.

   .. note::
      If the model determines that the text file is more recent than the cached binary file, it will ignore
      the cached binary file and use the corresponding text file.


.. command:: write_cache_files <boolean-value>

   Indicates if binary files for tables read from text files or generated as a result of enabling
   fast_detection_mode_ should be written to the cache directory. Subsequent runs that use the same data will read
   the data from the cache directory instead of reading the original text data or regenerating the fast detection mode
   tables.

   Use of cache files is highly recommended. For example, reading large atmospheric tables from cache is about 2 orders of
   magnitude faster than reading them from text files.

   **Default** true

.. command:: load_atmosphere <sosm-atmosphere-type> from <file-name>

   Loads the SOSM atmosphere definition from the specified file and associates it with the name specified by
   *<sosm-atmosphere-type>*. See :model:`SOSM_atmosphere_model` for directions on how to create atmosphere definitions.

   The standard WSF distribution includes several atmospheres generated using MODTRAN for wavelengths in the range 6680
   cm-1 (~1.5um) to 240 cm-1 (~41.67um) using a 20 cm-1 sample interval:

    sosm/modtran/us_std_day.txt             US Standard - Day
    sosm/modtran/us_std_night.txt           US Standard - Night
    sosm/modtran/mid_lat_summer_day.txt     Mid-Latitude Summer - Day
    sosm/modtran/mid_lat_summer_night.txt   Mid-Latitude Summer - Night
    sosm/modtran/mid_lat_winter_day.txt     Mid-Latitude Winter - Day
    sosm/modtran/mid_lat_winter_night.txt   Mid-Latitude Winter - Night

   All of the atmospheres included in the standard distribution were generated with the following non-default MODTRAN
   options:

   * Multiple Scattering (Card 1, IMULT=1)
   * Spectral Lambertian surfaces (Card 1, SURREF='LAMBER', 'farm')
   * CO2 mixing ratio of 365.0 ppmv as recommended by the manual (Card 1A, CO2MX=365.0)
   * RURAL extinction, VIS = 23km (Card 2, IHAZE=1)

   .. note::
      The first atmosphere that is loaded is defined to be the 'default' atmosphere unless
      default_atmosphere_ is provided.


.. command:: load_sensor <sosm-sensor-type> from <file-name>

   Loads the SOSM sensor definition from the specified file and associates it with the name specified by
   *<sosm-sensor-type>*.

   See :ref:`SOSM_sensor_model` for directions on creating a sensor model definitions.

   .. note::
      This command should be repeated for each definition required by the simulation.


.. command:: load_target <sosm-target-type> from <file-name>

   Loads the SOSM target model definition from the specified file and associates it with the name specified by
   *<sosm-target-type>*.

   See :ref:`SOSM_target_model_table` and :ref:`SOSM_target_model_simple` for directions on creating a target model definitions.

   .. note::
      This command should be repeated for each definition required by the simulation.


.. command:: map_sensor_type <wsf-sensor-type> <sosm-sensor-type>

   Indicates the SOSM sensor type *<sosm-sensor-type>* should be used when WSF wants to create an instance of
   WSF_SOSM_SENSOR of type *<wsf-sensor-type>*.

   When an instance of WSF_SOSM_SENSOR is created, WSF must determine the corresponding SOSM sensor definition to be
   used. It does this as follows:

   * If provided, use the value from sosm_sensor_type_ in the sensor mode definition.
   * For each level in the sensor hierarchy

    * Check the map_sensor_type_ list for an entry where *<sensor-type>:<sensor-mode>* matches the value of **<wsf-sensor-type>** in the entry.
    * Check the map_sensor_type_ list for an entry where *<sensor-type>* matches the value of *<wsf-sensor-type>* in the entry.
    * Check the load_sensor_ list for an entry where *<sensor-type:sensor-mode>* matches the value of **<sosm-sensor-type>** in the entry.
    * Check the load_sensor_ list for an entry where *<sensor-type>* matches the value of *<sosm-sensor-type>* in the entry.

   .. note::
      Except for very trivial test cases, it is recommended that the user always include a default mapping
      as follows so that every WSF WSF_SOSM_SENSOR will have a corresponding SOSM sensor type:

    map_sensor_type WSF_SOSM_SENSOR *<sosm-sensor-type>*

.. command:: map_target_type <wsf-platform-type> <sosm-target-type>

   Indicates that the SOSM target type *<sosm-target-type>* should be used when WSF wants to perform a detection attempt
   on an WSF platform type of *<wsf-platform-type>*.

   When WSF is going to perform a detection attempt on a target, it must determine the SOSM target type to be used. For
   each level in the inheritance hierarchy of the WSF target platform, the platform type is used as follows:

   * Check the map_target_type_ list for an entry where *<platform-type>* matches the value of *<wsf-target-type>* in the entry.
   * Check the load_target_ list for an entry where *<platform-type>* matches the value of *<sosm-target-type>* in the entry.

   .. note::
      Except for very trivial test cases, it is recommended that the user always include a default mapping
      as follows so that every WSF platform type will have a corresponding SOSM target type:

    map_target_type WSF_PLATFORM *<sosm-target-type>*

.. command:: default_atmosphere <sosm-type-name>

   Specifies the SOSM atmosphere type to be used when an SOSM sensor definition does not explicitly refer to a specific
   atmosphere type.

   **Default** The *<sosm-type-name>* from the first load_atmosphere_ command.

.. command:: fast_detection_mode <boolean-value>

   Indicate if 'fast_detection_mode' should be used. 'fast_detection_mode' is a special operating mode that is used to
   reduce computational overhead at the expense of a small loss in fidelity. Use of this mode is typically warranted when
   running real-time.

   When 'fast_detection_mode' is not active, the detection model must compute and sum the effects of each wavenumber bin
   within the spectral response of the sensor. Depending on the sensor, this can be 10's to 100's of bins. When
   'fast_detection_mode' is enabled the detection model will precompute the spectral interaction between the sensor and
   the atmosphere and the sensor and the target and then use this data during detection opportunities to eliminate the
   iteration over the wavenumber bins.

   If write_cache_files_ is true, the precomputed tables will be written to the cache directory where they can be
   reused for future runs.

   **Default** false

.. command:: debug_level <integer>

   Specifies the level of debugging information to be printed.

    * debug_level = 0; No debugging information will be produced.
    * debug_level = 1; Display integrated information.
    * debug_level > 1; Display integrated  and spectral information.

.. command:: spectral_print_format [ wavenumber | wavelength]

   Specifies the output format for spectral data when debug_level_ is greater than 1.

   **Default** wavenumber

.. command:: show_iripp_data

   If specified, spectral detection data will be produced in a format similar to IRIPP 'spec' data.


.. model:: sensor WSF_SOSM_SENSOR

.. command:: sosm_sensor_type <sosm-sensor-type>

   An optional command that specifies the SOSM sensor type to be used. See map_sensor_type_ for how this is used.

   **Default** The type name of the sensor.

.. command:: ranging_time <time-value>

   Adds range information to any track generated by this sensor after the specified time has elapsed.  This basically
   simulates that the system could triangulate and get the range after a sufficient period of time.

.. command:: ranging_time_track_quality <quality-value>

   If the ranging time is used to generate a track with range information, this parameter controls the track quality once
   range is valid.  The quality-value must be non-negative.
