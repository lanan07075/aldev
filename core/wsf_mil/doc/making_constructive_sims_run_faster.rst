Making Constructive Sims Run Faster
-----------------------------------

The items below typically can be adjusted without having a detrimental effect on the simulation. However, keep in mind what you are adjusting and what affect it will have on an individual platform. Severely adjusting frame rates can affect a simulation.  Adjusting event or replay outputs will not affect a simulation outcome.

* | **update_interval on movers**
  |  Setting the update_interval to less than 5 to 10 seconds for movers generally creates run time issues.
  |  However, guided movers absolutely need lower update intervals if used as a weapon.

* | **update_interval in scripts**
  |  Calling a script on a platform once a second is costly.
  |  Think about extending it out to 10 or so seconds or longer.

* | **frame_time in sensors**
  |  Going below 1 second takes up a lot of resources.  In addition, think about the time it takes to form a track.
  |  Example: If it normally takes a sensor 10 seconds to form a track once positive sensor detections occur, set the
     frame_time to 3.3 seconds for a 3 of 5 hits_to_establish_track.

* | :command:`dis_interface`
  |  Inputs that can be changed to radically change the size of a replay file (make it smaller which cuts down runtime)
     are:
  |  suppress_comm_data  - Do you really need to see the blue comm lines in visualization tools?
  |  heartbeat_timer - set it up to 100 (from a default of 5).
  |  entity_position_threshold - set it up to 10 meters (from a default of 1).
  |  entity_orientation_threshold - set it up to 10 degrees (from a default of 3)
  |  Keep in mind that setting these values DO NOT AFFECT THE SIMULATION.

* | :command:`event_output`
  |  Do you really need to log every detection attempt by the sensors?
  |  Do you really need to log every track update?
  |  Anything that is selected requires I/O which is expensive.
  |  Again, selection of event items to retain DO NOT AFFECT THE SIMULATION.

* | :command:`csv_event_output`
  |  Do you really need to log every detection attempt by the sensors?
  |  Do you really need to log every track update?
  |  Anything that is selected requires I/O which is expensive.
  |  Again, selection of event items to retain DO NOT AFFECT THE SIMULATION.

* | :command:`observer`
  |  If used to write to output or to log file can be expensive.
  |  Use care though as these may be used for simulation runtime also.

* | **write_ln or debug statements**
  |  Comment out every writeln and turn off debug statements.  Writing out to the screen requires I/O.

* | **replacing default mesh networks in comms**
  |  The default network type in comms is the mesh network, which scales very poorly with many
  |  members in the network: [(n * (n - 1)) / 2 ] edges, where n is the number of comms in the
  |  network. If larger networks are needed, try switching to a more scalable network type (such as star)
  |  or define the network entirely via the use of the generic network type to avoid excessive performance
  |  penalties to using the mesh network.
