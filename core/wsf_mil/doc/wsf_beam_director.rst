Overview
========

WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR is a sensor meant to be used as a beam director (target tracker) for a
High-Energy Laser (HEL).  Specifically, this sensor is meant to work
with the :model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON`.

This sensor has three modes: scanning, locked with imaging, and cued to image.
During the scan phase the laser sensor is cued to a location or track.
It uses this location as the center of its field-of-view.
It will then scan for targets within its scan field-of-view.  If it detects one,
it will "lock on" to this target and commence its imaging sequence.
Once an image is acquired, if it subtends a given critical
size (min_pixels_for_cue_), the sensor will "cue to the image," meaning
it simulates a lock onto a sub-portion of the image.  At this point, a co-pointed
HEL can fire.

The beam director sends specific messages during mode transitions.  These messages have the following type names:

::

   Transition          Message Name
   --------------------------------
   LOCKED-->CUED       CUED_TO_IMAGE
   CUED-->LOCKED       LOST_IMAGE_CUE
   LOCKED-->SCANNING   BREAKLOCK

When the "CUED_TO_IMAGE" message is received by the :model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON`, high-energy lasing commences.  This is
indicated in the simulation by a :ref:`DIRECTED_ENERGY_WEAPON_BEGIN_SHOT <DIRECTED_ENERGY_WEAPON_SHOT_INFO>` event.  If the
"LOST_IMAGE_CUE" is received while lasing, the high-energy lasing is aborted, and a
:ref:`DIRECTED_ENERGY_WEAPON_END_SHOT <DIRECTED_ENERGY_WEAPON_SHOT_INFO>` event is issued.

Mode Commands
=============

.. command:: angular_resolution <angle-value>

   Specify the angular resolution of the sensor.

   Default: 3.0E-5 radians

.. command:: perfect_correlation <boolean-value>

   Specify whether the sensor will perfectly correlate when tracking from an initial cue.

   Default: false (It will pick the object closest to the center of the field-of-view to track.)

.. command:: type  scanning | locked | cued

   Determines the type of mode.  Using the *type* input simplifies the task of modeling the beam director as a set of
   finer and finer tracking modes.  One typically specifies a scanning mode, one or more locked modes, and finally, a cued
   mode.  Once the cued mode is entered, a message is sent to the associated :model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON`, and HEL lasing
   commences.

   Default: *cued*

.. command:: min_pixels_for_cue <integer-value>

   Specify the minimum number of pixels required to initiate a successful transition to a cued mode.

   Default: 0
