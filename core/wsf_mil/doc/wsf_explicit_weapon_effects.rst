Overview
========

Defines commands that are common to all :command:`weapon_effects` classes for explicitly modeled weapons.

.. block:: WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON_EFFECTS

Commands
========

.. command:: maximum_radius <length-value>
   
   Defines the maximum slant range (distance from the detonation/impact point to the target) at which this weapon could
   possibly have an effect. Note that this is only used for limiting the number of platforms that must be checked for
   possible damage, effectively eliminated 'far-away' objects from consideration.
   
   If this value is not supplied, the derived class may provide a value. For instance, :model:`WSF_GRADUATED_LETHALITY` will
   set it to a value that is a little larger than the largest radius in any of its tables.
   
   If this value is supplied, it may also limit any value defined by a derived class. Again using
   :model:`WSF_GRADUATED_LETHALITY` as an example, if the largest radius from the tables is 200 meters, and this command
   specifies a value of 100 meters, only platforms within 100 meters of the detonation/impact point will be considered.
   This allows one to quickly limit a weapon_effects on a temporary basis.
   
   Default: 0 m (not supplied - no limit, or limited by the derived class)
