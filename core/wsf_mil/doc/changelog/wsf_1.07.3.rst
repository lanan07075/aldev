WSF 1.7.3 - 10 Apr 2012
-----------------------

General
=======

* Changed names for input and script types in the optional wsf_hel project, in order to adhere to the "WSF\_" naming
  convention, as follows:

       * INTERSECT_PROCESSOR -> WSF_INTERSECT_PROCESSOR

       * LASER_WEAPON -> WSF_LASER_WEAPON

       * HEL_LETHALITY -> WSF_HEL_LETHALITY

       * HEL_ASPECT_LETHALITY -> WSF_HEL_ASPECT_LETHALITY

       * BEAM_DIRECTOR -> WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR

       * LaserWeapon -> WsfLaserWeapon

       * BeamDirector -> WsfBeamDirector

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 8265)** Modified :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.on_message` so it would accept either WSF_DROP_TRACK_MESSAGE or
  WSF_TRACK_DROP_MESSAGE as a handler for :class:`WsfTrackDropMessage`. When WSF was created, the type of
  :class:`WsfTrackDropMessage` was confusingly named WSF_DROP_TRACK_MESSAGE instead of WSF_TRACK_DROP_MESSSAGE. This provides
  a transition path by allowing either form.

* **(CR 9290)** Corrected a problem where a platform using a **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** would continue to fly straight &
  level after being told to change course.  This error could previously be achieved by commanding it to
  :method:`WsfPlatform.GoToLocation <WsfPlatform.GoToLocation>` (or :method:`WsfPlatform.FollowRoute <WsfPlatform.FollowRoute>`), then
  command it to :method:`WsfPlatform.TurnToHeading <WsfPlatform.TurnToHeading>`, and then command it to fly to the original
  location (or route).

* **(CR 9339)** Corrected several problems with the evaluation of incidentally engaged targets when the
  :command:`weapon_effects` attribute allow_incidental_damage is provided.

     * When an incidental target was MISSED (i.e.: :command:`event_output` WEAPON_MISSED) the status said KILLED instead of
       MISSED if any previously evaluated incidental target in the same engagement was hit and killed.

     * The PkDrawn on the WEAPON_MISSED :command:`event_output` was reported even if a Pk  draw was not required (i.e.:
       outside the maximum possible lethal radius). It was showing the result from the last incidentally hit target in the
       same engagement.

     * Incidentally engaged targets that were moving at the time when the engagement was terminated used an
       out-of-date location for evaluating miss distance. This could cause a target to be incorrectly categorized as hit or
       missed.

* **(CR 9341)** The script method :method:`WsfPlatform.Route <WsfPlatform.Route>` would crash if called on a platform that
  did not have a mover.

* **(CR 9365 and 9393)** Corrected a problem where the **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** would report a higher speed externally, but
  would propagate at a slower rate than reported.

* **(CR 9370)** Fixed a bug where imperfect correlation with the :command:`cluster method <track_manager.correlation_method>`
  was not working when a :command:`filter` was also being used on a :command:`track_manager`.

* **(CR 9374)** Fixed a bug where a :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` was not reporting a type whenever a multi-transmitter system's
  last transmitter was not detected.

* **(CR 9390)** Fixed an issue with the :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` not working correctly with embedded
  :model:`WSF_RADIUS_EFFECT` commands.

* **(CR 9391)** Corrected a problem where the :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` command
  :command:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER.thrust_vectoring_time_limits` was not accepting valid values.

* **(CR 9400)** **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** would sometimes fail to detect that it had reached the target waypoint if
  :command:`platform.navigation_errors` were being used.

* **(CR 9402)** Corrected a problem where the speed flown by **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** was different from the requested
  speed by 2-3% due to a different atmosphere model being used by the underlying model.

* **(CR 9416)** Corrected a missing capability in the :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` implementation where the
  :command:`false_target_screener` target forcing commands and the :model:`WSF_RADIUS_EFFECT` effects were not being accounted for in
  the :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` implementation.

* Fixed an issue with propagating the track errors associated with :command:`EW Effects <electronic_warfare_effect>` in a
  :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` types when **compute_measurment_errors** was set to true.

* Fixed an issue where :class:`WsfArticulatedPart` methods X,Y,Z,Yaw,Pitch,Roll could return old information.

* **(CR 9441)** Corrected a problem where the SENSOR_MODE_DEACTIVATED event was not being issued when a mode was
  implicitly deselected as a result of the selection of a new mode of a single-select sensor.

* **(CR 9485)** Corrected a problem where programs would crash if the script method
  :class:`WsfPlatformPart.ProcessInput <WsfPlatformPart>` was erroneously used to edit a non-existing sensor mode. The program will now issue
  a warning message and ignore the attempt.

* **(CR 9493)** Corrected a problem where multi-hop :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` relays were causing a crash. This only
  occurred if the final relay attempt in a multi-hop scenario failed.

* **(CR 9511)** Corrected three problems with script compile errors in the :command:`behavior_tree`.  The behavior tree
  now reports script compile errors found in its script blocks, said errors now do not cause a crash, and "unknown
  script" errors are now reported.

* **(CR 9512)** Fixed an interpolation problem with the :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER`. When mover updates occurred in-between
  points defined in the input file, the calculated intermediate position was wrong.

* **(CR 9541)** Corrected an infinite loop problem in the :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` when multiple comm devices on
  the same network could all act as relays but none could deliver the message.

* **(CR 9564)** Corrected a problem where :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` could miss detecting the end of the burn phase of a
  stage if the thrust_duration time was exceeded before all the fuel was consumed.

Enhancements
============

* Added a new concept called [[Reference Values]], which allow the value of a many commands to be derived from a
  script variable.

* Added :model:`WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR`, which provides the mechanisms to implement message processing delays and message
  routing. This replaces **WSF_DELAY_PROCESSOR** and offers new capabilities while still being compatible.
  **WSF_DELAY_PROCESSOR** can still be referenced from input files, but it actually use the new capability.

* Added the **synchronous** :model:`operating mode <WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR>` to :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR`. This
  allows multiple-aperture systems (such as multi-faced ESA systems) to be more easily modeled.

* Added the ability to specify how sensor detection attempts are scheduled when using the default sensor scheduler.
  (See :command:`scheduler_type.default.scan_scheduling`)

* Added the script method :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetTimeToPoint` to :class:`WsfWaypoint`.

* Added script methods :method:`WsfWeaponEngagement.CompletionTime`, :method:`WsfWeaponEngagement.PkDrawn` and additional
  forms of :method:`WsfWeaponEngagement.MissDistance` and :method:`WsfWeaponEngagement.TargetLocation` (additional form) to
  :class:`WsfWeaponEngagement`.

* Provided a default implementation for WsfImplicitWeapon, and added :model:`WSF_IMPLICIT_WEAPON` as a new weapon type.
  This implementation allows engagement both against specific platforms, as well as using a track to provide a target
  location.  If a launch computer is provided in the weapon definition, the estimated time to intercept will be used as
  the duration of the implicit engagement.  Otherwise one must call :method:`CeaseFire <WsfWeapon.CeaseFire>` to end an
  engagement.

* Added in support for creating **triangular** lattice arrays for the :ref:`antenna_pattern.esa_pattern`.

* Added in support for defining element patterns (normalize wrt isotropic (dBi)) in
  :ref:`antenna_pattern.esa_pattern`.

* Modified the :command:`_.navigation_errors` model to use parameters that make more closely correspond to
  the performance specifications for real IMU systems. Also updated **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** and :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` to
  consider navigation errors when making its computations.

* **(CR 8675)** Added the capability to specify receiver and antenna commands in the :model:`WSF_SLB_EFFECT` and
  :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT`.

* **(CR 9344)** Added the command :command:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR.track_processor` to :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR`, which allows
  the selection of an alternate track processor to be used as the source of tracks for evaluation.

* **(CR 9401)** Modified the sensor script methods WsfSensor.EM_RcvrCount and WsfSensor.EM_XmtrCount
  (and the underlying framework calls) to return 0 if called prior to initialization and modified many script methods to
  check for a null antenna pointer. This is to prevent crashes if the user attempts to call :class:`sensor <WsfSensor>` script
  methods prior to the sensor completing initialization. Most methods that directly or indirectly access modes,
  transmitters, receivers or antennas will be not perform any useful function if called prior to the completion of
  initialization.

* Added the script method :method:`WsfPlatform.FutureLocation` to :class:`WsfPlatform` to retrieve the anticipated location
  of a platform at some specified time in the future. This only works for platforms that employ specific types of movers.

* Documented the formerly undocumented :method:`WsfPlatform.RoutePointIndex` in :class:`WsfPlatform`.

* **(CR 9442)** Added the capability to report the range rate :command:`sensor_mode.reports_range_rate` of a track by a
  sensor.

* Added more script methods to :class:`WsfFuel` to allow for improved fuel management in scripting and behaviors.

* Added the callback SIMULATION_INITIALIZING to :command:`observer`.

* Added the script method :method:`MATH.Log(value,base) <Math.Log>` to return the logarithm of a number with respect to a
  specified base.

* Added script methods :method:`WsfGeoPoint.OffsetNED` and :method:`WsfGeoPoint.OffsetRBE` to :class:`WsfGeoPoint`.

* **(CR 9487, 9488, 9489)** Added script methods :method:`WsfPlatform.InfraredRadiantIntensity`,
  :method:`WsfPlatform.OpticalCrossSection` and :method:`WsfPlatform.RadarCrossSection` to :class:`WsfPlatform`. These methods
  provide to return the signature of a platform when viewed from a specified location.

* Added the capability for :class:`zones <WsfZone>` to draw themselves using :class:`WsfDraw`.  This is similar to the existing
  "DebugDraw..." capability but uses a :class:`WsfDraw` object that is passed as an argument to the script methods.

* **(CR 9490)** Updated :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` and :ref:`WSF_VIDEO_PROCESSOR` to allow specification of a time
  duration that must elapse before declaring detection, classification or identification.

* Added static script methods :method:`WsfComm.IsA_TypeOf() <WsfComm.IsA_TypeOf>`,
  :method:`WsfMover.IsA_TypeOf() <WsfMover.IsA_TypeOf>`, :method:`WsfProcessor.IsA_TypeOf() <WsfProcessor.IsA_TypeOf>`,
  :method:`WsfSensor.IsA_TypeOf() <WsfSensor.IsA_TypeOf>` and :method:`WsfWeapon.IsA_TypeOf() <WsfWeapon.IsA_TypeOf>`, which allows one
  to determine if an object of specified type inherits (or derives from) an object of a specified base type.

* **(CR 9496)** Added the ability to set the "Type of Network Enabled Weapon" field in the J11.0 Initial word. It
  was currently a spare.

* Added MGRS (Military Grid Reference System) conversions to/from lat, lon.  In code these are available in
  UtEllipsoidalEarth.  In script one may use the methods :method:`WsfPlatform::LocationMGRS() <WsfPlatform.LocationMGRS>` and
  :method:`WsfPlatform::SetLocationMGRS() <WsfPlatform.SetLocationMGRS>`.

* **(CR 9577)** Added the :command:`dis_interface.simple_miss_reporting` command to the 'dis_interface', which causes
  all detonation reports that are not 1 to be reported as 6.

* Added :command:`timing_method` command to change how WSF maintains the
  realtime clock.
