* **IMPORTANT NOTE**: In the **NEXT** release **AFTER** this release the new guided movers and guidance computer
  will become the default definitions:
   
   * **WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** will refer to the new implementation currently
     available as **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**.
   
   * **WSF_GUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** will refer to the new implementation currently available as
     **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER**.
   
   * **WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_UNGUIDED_MOVER** will refer to the new implementation currently available
     as **WSF_NEW_UNGUIDED_MOVER**.
  
  The old models will continue to be available as **WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**, **WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER** and
  **WSF_OLD_UNGUIDED_MOVER**.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6790)** Allow file names and path names to be quoted so they can contain embedded blanks.

* **(CR 7734)** Fixed a bug where the script 'Set' container would fail with the list constructor (i.e. Set<string>
  s = { "1", "2" };).

* **(CR 7782)** The radar detection threshold and integration gain was being computed incorrectly if a
  Marcum-Swerling detector was employed. Because of the implementation is was primarily an issue for those radars that
  also employed 'one_m2_detect_range'. Radars that provided another means to determine receiver noise power were only
  minimally affected.

* **(CR 7792)** The Spectral Optical Sensor Model (:command:`SOSM <sosm_interface>`) was incorrectly selecting the first
  :command:`_.target_model_sosm_table_commands.state` defined in the :ref:`target_model <SOSM_target_model_table>` rather than the last
  one if no state matched the target conditions at the time of the detection attempt. The documentation was also improved
  to more clearly define which state will be selected.

* **(CR 7917)** A few colons were missing from the EM interaction data being printed out in an event output file.
  This was causing problems when parsing the file by relying on the colons to separate the values and their corresponding
  tags.

* **(CR 7922)** Fixed a problem with the script methods :method:`MATH.AngleIsBetween <Math.AngleIsBetween>` and
  :method:`MATH.AngleWithinTolerence <Math.AngleWithinTolerance>`. Both methods expected angles in radians not degrees. This is
  inconsistent with other script functions.

* **(CR 7938)** Fixed an issue with the :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT` not properly changing frequencies and modes. The
  :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT` now schedules frequency and mode changes for the sensors to execute at a specified time, or the
  next simulation frame if immediate. The scheduling of frequency and mode changes allow for the current interaction
  results to carry out with the current states and simplifies the logic required in the interaction when a change occurs
  mid-way through an interaction calculation.

* **(CR 7961)** The :method:`SetCurrentTarget <WsfPlatform.SetCurrentTarget>` method assumed a local track as input and did
  not handle sensor track input correctly.

* **(CR 7970)** Fixed a bug with how data was being packed into the 32-bit parameter type field. This field is part
  of the articulated part record, which is part of the entity state pdu.

* **(CR 7982)** Fixed a bug where :class:`FileIO` was unable to read multiple files in a row on Windows.

* Fixed an issue when false target jamming each beam of a multi-beam beam radar with diverse frequencies. Each beam
  was not getting false target blips properly due to software name mismatches within the code.

* Fixed a bug where the :command:`_.aux_data` input inside sensor blocks was sometimes being applied to a :command:`_.receiver`
  instead of the sensor.

* **(CR 8017)** Corrected a problem where the SUPPRESSOR-compatibility script method
  :method:`WsfPlatform.RelativeOffsetOf` of :class:`WsfPlatform` was returning incorrect values. This problem was causing several
  anomalies that were being observed in the classified scenarios that had been converted from SUPPRESSOR.

* **(CR 8026)** Corrected an issue where the :command:`false_target_screener` would block the first real target track from
  being created within the sensors tracker without any false targets present. Issue was that the screener was not
  properly setup for the first track when a screener was attached.

* Fixed some minor bugs related to using :command:`dis_interface.deferred_connection_time` with :class:`WsfDraw` or
  :command:`dis_interface.record`.

* Removed the source of several memory leaks. Major leaks were corrected in the :method:`write_str<__BUILTIN__.write_str>`
  method, the :method:`MATH.LatToString <Math.LatToString>` and :method:`MATH.LonToString <Math.LonToString>` methods, and the routing
  methods within :class:`WsfRouteNetwork`. Other leaks were corrected in capabilities that were infrequently used.

* **(CR 8192)** Add :command:`terrain.raw-dted` as an alias to :command:`terrain.raw_dted` in the :command:`terrain` block for
  compatibility with CME 'geodata'
  commands.

* **(CR 8197)** Updated :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR` to include two new
  :model:`report_methods <WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR>` which provide SUPPRESSOR-like track reporting. These help to
  eliminate problems associated with the bi-directional reporting of fused tracks.

* **(CR 8234)** Corrected two problems hen using latitude/longitude limits with
  :command:`sensor_plot horizontal_map <horizontal_map>`,

  * The column headers for :command:`horizontal_map.gnuplot_file` indicated columns 1 and 2 were down-range
    and cross-range when they should have read latitude and longitude.

  * :command:`horizontal_map.pd_map_file` wasn't producing lat/lon values for the independent variables.

Enhancements
============

* **(CR 7701)** Relocated the :command:`_.transmitter.frequency_channels`,
  :command:`_.transmitter.frequency_list` and :command:`_.transmitter.alternate_frequency` from
  :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` to the :command:`_.transmitter` to allow scenario file inputs to override type definition and
  sensor input commands for frequency setups and selections.

* **(CR 7702)** Added the capability :command:`electronic_protect` techniques to mitigate
  :command:`electronic_attack` techniques by user selectable class names via the electronic_attack
  :command:`WSF_EA_TECHNIQUE.mitigation_class_name` and electronic_protect
  :command:`WSF_EP_TECHNIQUE.mitigated_technique_classes` input commands.

* Renamed the :command:`electronic_protect` **WSF_RADAR_AGILITY_EFFECT** to :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT`.

* Added the ability  for :command:`comm`  devices to change frequencies via the :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT`. This agility can be
  setup by defining :command:`_.transmitter.frequency_channels`, :command:`_.transmitter.frequency_list`
  or :command:`_.transmitter.alternate_frequency` coupled with the
  :command:`comm.jamming_perception_threshold` and
  :command:`comm.frequency_select_delay` and defining an :command:`electronic_protect`
  technique with the :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT` and **frequency_changing** as the **agility_type**

* **(CR 7734)** Added the ability dynamically set a :method:`scaling factor <WsfPlatform.SetRadarSigScaleFactor>` to be
  applied to a platform signature. This allows off-design signatures to be created on a per-platform basis by simple
  scaling. The scaling factors can be communicated to WSF over :command:`dis_interface` via articulated parts.

* Added the capability to represent a "vegetation layer" as part of the :command:`terrain` elevation data.  This layer is
  used to provide information about any vegetation (trees, shrubs, etc) above the standard "bare earth" terrain layer. 
  Currently only the float_grid format can be used to specify a vegetation layer.  These new inputs are
  :command:`terrain.float_grid_vegetation` and
  :command:`terrain.float_grid_vegetation_file`.  The standard bare earth terrain layer must also be
  specified (:command:`terrain.float_grid` or :command:`terrain.float_grid_file`).

* Added :class:`WsfZone` script class for accessing Zone Definitions and Zone Sets defined on a platform.

* Modified the :command:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE.maximum_time_of_flight` in :model:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE` to allow the specification to
  come from the launch computer.

* **(CR 7802)** Added the ability to model repeater jammer type weapons to the :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER` via the
  :model:`repeater ... end_repeater <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` input block with :model:`jammer mode <WSF_RF_JAMMER>`.
  Current functionality is limited and will become more complex to meet user needs as time progresses and it is utilized.

* **(CR 7841)** Added the :ref:`MaskedByTerrain <WsfPlatform.MaskedByTerrain>` script method to :ref:`WsfPlatform`.

* **(CR 7921)** Added in the :command:`event_output` messages :ref:`docs/event/comm_events:COMM_FREQUENCY_CHANGED` and
  :ref:`docs/event/sensor_events:SENSOR_FREQUENCY_CHANGED` to produce a message reflecting frequency changes on :command:`comm` and :command:`sensor` devices
  during the simulation.

* Added the ability to redefine :command:`zone` s and :command:`zone_set` s at either the global or platform level. Associated with
  this, the binding of :command:`zone_set.use_zone` and :command:`zone_set.use_exclude_zone` in :command:`zone_set` and
  :command:`platform.use_zone` in :command:`platform` was changed so it binds to the referenced zone when it is first used in the
  simulation rather than when it appears in the input stream.

* Added script methods to some existing classes:

   * :class:`WsfRoute - Index operator '[]' for accessing waypoints <WsfRoute>`

   * :class:`WsfRoute - Intersect(), TotalLength(), Remove(), LocationAtDistance(), DistanceAlongRoute(), DistanceFromRoute(), SubrouteByDistance() <WsfRoute>`

   * :method:`WsfGeoPoint - Construct(string) <WsfGeoPoint.Construct>`

   * :method:`WsfRouteNetwork - Routes() <WsfRouteNetwork.Routes>`

   * :class:`WsfWaypoint - Speed(), SetSpeed(), Location(), SetLocation() <WsfWaypoint>`

   * :class:`WsfGroup - Auxiliary Data Methods <WsfGroup>`

* Added documentation for previously undocumented script class: :class:`QuadTree`

* Added script classes :class:`Signal` and :class:`Method` which implements the 'Signals and Slots' language construct.

* Added the :command:`event_output.flush_output` command to :command:`event_output`.

* Added :model:`WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`, which is recommended over the previous (but still available)
  :model:`WSF_ATA_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` implementation.

* Weapons that use deferred launching (eg. CSIMS) now correctly report their spatial domain.

* Added Auxiliary methods for storing objects - :ref:`AuxDataObject(),
  SetAuxData(string, Object) <WsfPlatform.Auxiliary_Data_Methods>`

* **(CR 7954)** Added the ability for a comm radio device to attempt to retransmit each message up to
  :model:`retransmit_attempts <WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` number of times if previous transmission attempts
  were unsuccessful.  A delay of :model:`retransmit_delay <WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` will occur between each
  message retransmit attempt. In addition, added the ability for the message transfer rate of the radio message to depend
  upon the current transmitter/receiver signal-to-noise-ratio by specifying a SNR->transfer-rate mapping table
  (:model:`snr_transfer_rate_table <WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>`).  In addition, added the ability to specify
  an onboard comm device that the originally-ordered comm device can order to attempt message transmission (using the
  command :model:`retransmit_link <WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>`) if the originally-ordered comm device was unable to
  successfully complete message transmission.

* Added :model:`WSF_EXOATMOSPHERIC_LETHALITY`, which determines weapon Pk from tables of terminal impact velocity and
  impact angle.  Intended to be used in hit-to-kill assessments.

* **(CR 7891)** Added :command:`WSF_SOSM_SENSOR.ranging_time` to SOSM sensor.

* **(CR 8010)** Modified TDOA algorithm for 3-platform solution and added
  :model:`ground_target_altitude_error <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>` attribute.

* **(CR 8023)** Added range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity errors to WSF_TRACK_EFFECT and the ability to walk-off
  these errors at a linear rate.

* :class:`Method` objects can now be used as callbacks on waypoints using :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetCallback` or
  :method:`WsfRoute.AddCallbackToLastWaypoint`.

* Added a lot of content to the :command:`behavior_tree` page and the :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR` page.

* Added the :model:`altitude_offset <WSF_ROAD_MOVER>` option.  The primary benefit to using this option is that
  lines-of-sight calculations for ground targets are accurate, even when no altitude is specified in the routes
  themselves.

* **(CR 8145)** Added in the capability to multi-thread platform and sensor updates in event-stepped and
  frame-stepped simulation executives. See :ref:`Simulation_Control_Commands` for more information.

* Added the **switch_sides** command to the :command:`ATG_LAR_AND_LC_GENERATOR` to show the weapon generation lars on the
  left side of the launching platform.
