WSF 1.6.6 - 28 April 2010
-------------------------

Important Notes
===============

* Many of the radar sensor (:model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`) definitions in the classified repository have been updated to
  include:
   
   * Modified :command:`clutter_model` input definitions.
   
   * Modified :command:`propagation_model` input definitions
   
   * Addition of :command:`Electronic Protect techniques <electronic_protect>` (i.e. side-lobe cancelers, side-lobe blankers and
     frequency agility).
   
   * Addition of a :command:`false_target_screener` to allow the radar sensor to interact with false targets defined in the
     :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT`
   
   * Addition of :model:`jamming perception thresholds <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`.
   
   * Addition of :model:`alternate_frequency <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`,
     :model:`frequency_list <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`, and :model:`frequency_channels <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`.

* The addition of the :model:`alternate_frequency <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`,
  :model:`frequency_list <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`, and :model:`frequency_channels <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` will
  cause some of these radars to have a different frequency than was previously used in the scenarios as defined in the
  reference for the input command. Furthermore, some radars employ the :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT` that specifies
  **frequency_agility** to allow it to automatically change frequency in the presence of jamming that is over the jamming
  perception thresholds defined for the sensor. For all of the sensors the SUPPRESSOR database did not have a delay on
  the selection of the frequencies (see :model:`frequency_select_delay <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`), so the
  change in frequency will happen immediately. To randomize the frequencies for radar sensors (with multiple frequencies)
  at simulation startup see :command:`randomize_radar_frequencies`.

* Many of the current platform jamming scripts do not currently employ script methods to handle frequency agile
  radar sensors. A jammer that does is modeled in the unclassified **aea_demo** scenario that can be used as a template
  to incorporate a closed loop jammer that responds to radar sensor's frequency changes, as well as multi-beam
  multi-frequency radars using a tracks :ref:`Signal <WsfTrack.Signal_Methods>` capability.

General
=======

* Added the ability to use the :ref:`ALARM <ALARM_Interface>` (Advanced Low Altitude Radar Model) clutter and propagation
  models in :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` (non-exportable version only)

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 7354)** When a platform (platformA) is unable to transmit a message to a desired destination platform
  (platformB) directly, and Begins to search for available platforms with receivers capable of accepting and relaying
  (i.e. platformC) the message to the destination platform Then, only allow platformA to forward the message to the
  platformC receiver if the platformC relay-enabled receiver has a transmitter configured for relay that is currently
  (main change) on the same network as a receiver on the destination platform.  Otherwise, the platformC relay-enabled
  receiver will not receive any message to queue.

* **(CR 7434)** Corrected problems with versions of :method:`WsfPlatform.FollowRoute` that take a waypoint index or
  label.

* **(CR 7505)** Corrected a problem where the :command:`antenna_pattern steered_array_pattern <antenna_pattern>` antenna pattern generator
  would crash if invalid input was provided.

* **(CR 7509)** Corrected a problem where the :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT` was causing a segmentation fault when used with
  :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT` jamming.

* **(CR 7521)** Added the ability to read multiple Link 16 messages from a single DIS Signal PDU. This was causing a
  problem with the Link 16 model being used by VWC & ADS.

* **(CR 7600)** Corrected a problem where some uses of the scripting language could lead to high memory usage and
  slow execution -- specifically when creating multiple unique strings.

Enhancements
============

* Modified **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** to allow massless stages that can be used for 'coast' stages with a change of
  aero properties.

* Modified the script :command:`observer` SENSOR_DETECTION_ATTEMPT function call to include the boolean result of the
  detection attempt.

* Added a mode.pd_range_table to the :model:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR`. 

* Added methods to :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` to support the determination of multiple launch windows
  and updated :class:`WsfLaunchComputer` to allow retrieval of the data from script.

* Added the :command:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER.maximum_intercept_slant_range` command to
  :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` to facilitate the modeling of 'launch on remote' firing doctrine.

* **(CR 7582)** Add the script method :method:`WsfArticulatedPart.ApparentLocationOf` to :class:`WsfArticulatedPart` to allow
  the computation of a sensor cue that includes the effects of atmospheric refraction.

* Added script methods to :class:`WsfGeoPoint` to query the :method:`terrain height <WsfGeoPoint.TerrainHeight>` at the point and
  the :method:`height above terrain <WsfGeoPoint.HeightAboveTerrain>` of the point.

* Added new methods to the :class:`string` script type [Substring(), Split(), Join(), Strip(), Upper(), Lower()]

* Added 2 new properties to :ref:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER.Route_Mover_Commands` to provide simple "crowd movement":
  :model:`speed_variance_percent <WSF_SURFACE_MOVER>`,
  :model:`path_variance_radius <WSF_SURFACE_MOVER>`

* Added :class:`WsfGroup` capability to aggregate platforms and platform parts into functional groups. See
  :ref:`WsfPlatform <WsfPlatform.Group_Methods>` and :ref:`WsfPlatformPart <WsfPlatformPart.Group_Methods>`

* Added the capability to define :model:`frequency_channels <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` and a
  :model:`frequency_list <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` on a :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.

* **(CR 7633)** Added script methods RelativeAzimuthOf and RelativeElevationOf to
  :method:`WsfPlatform <WsfPlatform.RelativeAzimuthOf>` and :method:`WsfArticulatedPart <WsfArticulatedPart.RelativeAzimuthOf>` to
  provide the azimuth and elevation of a point with respect to the coordinate frame of a platform or a platform subsystem
  (e.g. sensor). This includes all considerations of roll, pitch, yaw and cuing.
