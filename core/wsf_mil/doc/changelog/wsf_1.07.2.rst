WSF 1.7.2 - 27 Oct 2011
-----------------------

Removal of Transition Object Types In The Next Release
======================================================

Over the last couple of years several movers were reimplemented in such a way that compatibility between the old and new
implementations could not be maintained transparently. As such, both old and new forms coexisted under different names
(i.e. **OLD** and **NEW**). The default implementation (i.e.: name without the **OLD** or **NEW**) eventually changed
from referring to the old implementation to referring to the new implementation.

The new implementations have been the default implementation for over year. Effective with the **NEXT** release, the
old implementations will be removed from the code and the transition names (**OLD** and **NEW**) will be removed as
follows:

* **WSF_OLD_AIR_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_AIR_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_GROUND_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_GROUND_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_ROAD_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_ROAD_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_SUBSURFACE_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_SUBSURFACE_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_SURFACE_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_SURFACE_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_6DOF_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_6DOF_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`)
* **WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** (use :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER`)

If you haven't already done so, please convert your definitions to use the standard (non-transition) names.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 8828)** Removed the 'beam_color_rgba' capability from :ref:`Antenna_commands` that was implemented in version
  :ref:`wsf_1.7.1`. The non-standard DIS PDU caused problems for some simulations and resulted in larger replay files. A
  different implementation may be provided at some point in the future.

* **(CR 8861)** Corrected a problem where :model:`WSF_TBM_MOVER` could hang in an infinite loop if the target was at a
  higher MSL altitude than the launcher (as could occur when using terrain).

* **(CR 8865)** Corrected a problem where the :command:`event_output` events SENSOR_KILLED, SENSOR_NON_OPERATIONAL and
  SENSOR_OPERATIONAL were not properly terminated.

* **(CR 8875)** Corrected a problem in :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` (as well as **WSF_RADIO_XMTR** and
  **WSF_RADIO_RCVR**) where a message that required two or more relay hops (e.g. a STATCOM cross-link) could get stuck in
  an infinite cycle of being transmitted between two nodes.

* **(CR 8908)** Corrected a problem where the script method
  :method:`WsfPlatformPart.SetOperational <WsfPlatformPart.SetOperational>` would not parse using the syntax in the documentation.

* **(CR 8916)** Corrected a problem where raw tracks filtered by the track manager on one node and then reported to
  another node, could get marked in such a way on the receiving node that they would never get evaluated by
  :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR` unless :command:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR.evaluate_candidate_tracks` was set to 'true'.

* **(CR 8932)** Corrected a problem where the simulation would crash if a :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR` was used when a
  :command:`dis_interface.record` was enabled.

* **(CR 8933)** Corrected a situation where enabled simulation :command:`observer` would get called multiple
  times per event if a multi-run :ref:`Monte_Carlo_Iteration` execution was used.

* **(CR 8966)** Corrected a problem in [[sensor_plot flight_path_analysis]] with the treatment of velocity from TSPI
  files. The velocity direction derived by sensor_plot was inconsistent with the derivation in :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER`. The
  magnitude was correct, but the direction could be different.

* **(CR 8984)** Corrected a problem in the calculation of the message transfer rate in :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER` and
  :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` when 'transfer_rate' was being defined on the communication network and
  not in the communication device.

* **(CR 9002)** Corrected a minor problem in the :ref:`GENAP <antenna_pattern.genap_pattern>` cosecant antenna generator
  which cause a slight (0.1 degree) elevation shift in the resulting pattern. Also applied the most recent patches from
  SUPPRESSOR.

* **(CR 9025)** Corrected a problem where radio based communications were not being affected by :ref:`zone-based_attenuation`.

* **(CR 9038)** Corrected a problem in :model:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR` where the earth_radius_multiplier was being
  accepted, but didn't affect the detection results. This prevented using the sensor as a simple low-fidelity surrogate
  for a radar sensor.

* **(CR 9047)** Corrected a problem where the sensing chance list entry for a target platform was sometimes not
  getting deleted when the target platform was deleted. This occurred only for target tracking sensors. The main impact
  was a performance problem caused by the constant reallocation of the list as new platforms were added to the simulation.

* **(CR 9051)** Corrected several problems in :model:`WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER` that was causing erratic behavior.

* **(CR 9054)** The common orientation for satellites using :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER` or :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER` will be
  "right side up, " so that platforms appear to fly "straight and level."  More specifically, satellites will be oriented
  so that the local z axis points to nadir (Earth center), the x axis is in the direction of motion (perpendicular to z
  and in the same plane as z and the ECI velocity vector), and y is perpendicular to both x and z.  In STK it is
  identical with the attitude option "Nadir alignment with ECI velocity constraint."

* **(CR 9061)** Corrected a problem in :class:`WsfSensorInteraction` and
  :class:`WsfCommInteraction` where range values were mistakenly being return in units of kilometers
  rather than meters.

* **(CR 9088)** Corrected an issue with the :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` track type reporting being overridden by the
  'reports_type' flag when using the 'reported_emitter_type' block input commands.

* **(CR 9098)** Corrected an issue where the last timestamp in the DIS output stream was always the value of the
  'end_time' command, even if the simulation was terminated early (e.g.: by using
  :method:`WsfSimulation.Terminate() <WsfSimulation.Terminate>`). The last timestamp will now be set to the maximum simulation
  time that was achieved.

* **(CR 9133)** Corrected a problem with the :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR`, **WSF_IR10T_SENSOR**, and
  :ref:`sosm_interface.WSF_SOSM_SENSOR` when using ranging_time and ranging_time_track_quality where the
  track quality was being applied before the range was valid.

* **(CR 9135)** When attempting to estimate a pseudo-3D location from a 2D (range-bearing) track, the location would
  be corrupted if the slant range was less than the assumed altitude used to compute the location.

* **(CR 9137)** Corrected a problem where the origin of a sensor report incorrectly used the platform location
  instead of the sensor antenna location. This was causing a error in the track report if the sensor antenna was offset
  from the origin of the platform, as range and angles are measured relative to the origin of the sensor antenna.

* **(CR 9142)** Fixed an issue where stopping a jamming assignment when a repeater was operating in manual mode with
  signal following set to 'true' would fail.

* **(CR 9149)** Corrected an issue where a *csims_interface* missile launched from moving platform (e.g.: a
  ship) would occasionally abort immediately after launch with an erroneous 'hit ground' message.

* **(CR 9163)** Prevented the sending of jamming systems in the DIS emission PDUs that are off and have been off for
  the previous sending to lessen the DIS loading.

* **(CR 9165)** Correct a problem where the incorrect beam position would be computed if the device was cued, the
  azimuth to the target had the opposite sign of the cued azimuth, and the scan volume about the cue spanned the +/- 180
  degree azimuth line (relative to the uncued orientation).

* **(CR 9190)** Corrected a problem in the altitude triggers of :model:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE` (and the derived variants
  :model:`WSF_AIR_TARGET_FUSE` and :model:`WSF_GROUND_TARGET_FUSE`) where detonation was incorrectly occurring when any altitude
  sample was above/below the criteria value. Detonation will now occur when crossing the criteria value in the proper
  direction, as specified in the documentation.

* **(CR 9267)** Corrected a problem where :command:`sensor_plot_flight_path_analysis <flight_path_analysis>` was
  improperly manipulating the heading from a TSPI file.

* **(CR 9268)** Corrected a problem where the TIME_NOW variable would not reflect the current simulation time if the
  script was invoked as a result of calling :method:`WsfSimulation.ExecuteAtTime <WsfSimulation.ExecuteAtTime>`,
  :method:`WsfPlatform.ExecuteAtTime <WsfPlatform.ExecuteAtTime>` or :method:`WsfProcessor.ExecuteAtTime <WsfProcessor.ExecuteAtTime>`
  specifying a time in the past.

* **(CR 9303)** Corrected a problem in :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` where the reported location data for tracking radars would
  be incorrect if the sensing platform had a significant orientation change (i.e. started to bank) between the time the
  detection attempt occurred and the data was reported.

Enhancements
============

* **(CR 8683)** Added support for loading PLT signature files in 3-column format.

* Various modifications were made to the image processing architecture:

  * Merged the capabilities of :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` and :ref:`WSF_VIDEO_PROCESSOR` into :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR`,
    which will now process static images or a stream of images (video). :ref:`WSF_VIDEO_PROCESSOR` still exists, but is simply
    a synonym for :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR`.

  * Added the ability to define a :command:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR.filter` in :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` to be used when
    processing image streams. If a filter is defined, it will be used to generate a filtered position and velocity in the
    output tracks.

  * Modified the pixel count attribute in the :method:`image <WsfImage.PixelCount>` and :method:`track <WsfTrack.PixelCount>` objects
    so it is now a floating point value.

  * Added a normalize pixel intensity attribute in the :method:`image <WsfImage.PixelIntensity>`.

  * Added the :method:`minimum <WsfImage.MinimumLevel>` and :method:`maximum <WsfImage.MaximumLevel>` signal level attributes to the
    image. :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` will now compute an intensity based on the radar signature.

  * :method:`WsfImage.BackgroundLevel() <WsfImage.BackgroundLevel>` and :method:`WsfImage.SignalLevel() <WsfImage.SignalLevel>` now
    return raw signal levels instead of being divided by the noise level.

  * The tracks created from static images (e.g.: spot SAR images) will now always report a zero velocity. Otherwise
    the velocity in the local track into which the track is fused will never go to zero.

* Added support for MIL-STD-210 Non-Standard Atmospheres :doc:`../atmosphere`.

* Added support for unit type of angular inertia (mass*length*length) [[Values|units]].

* Added the :command:`track_manager.aux_data_fusion_rules` to :command:`track_manager` to control the fusion of :command:`_.aux_data`
  variables from a raw tracks into local tracks.

* Added :class:`WsfSensor` script methods: :method:`WsfSensor.SetFOV_Azimuth`, :method:`WsfSensor.SetFOV_Elevation`,
  :method:`WsfSensor.SetFOV_Range`.

* Added the command :command:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR.pixel_count` to :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR`.  Used in conjunction with new
  :class:`WsfSensor` methods to change field of view allows *zooming* the WSF_EOIR_SENSOR in script.

* **(CR 8866)** Added the on_death attribute for :command:`platform` which lets a user define the
  disposition of a platform when it is killed. The default is to remove the platform from the simulation, but now an
  option exists to allow the platform to be retained, but with all its systems disabled.

* Added the :command:`dis_interface.playback` command to the :command:`dis_interface`, which allow the entities contained in a
  DIS 'replay' file to be injected back into a simulation as regular WSF platforms.

* **(CR 8872)** Added the ability to use a communications filter with a JTIDS terminal for use by the VWC and the
  Comm Effects Engine. This is a code enhancement with no impact to users.

* **(CR 8883)** Added the ability to delete an aux_data variable in :method:`WsfGroup <WsfGroup.DeleteAuxData>`,
  :method:`WsfMessage <WsfMessage.DeleteAuxData>`, :method:`Platform <WsfPlatform.DeleteAuxData>`,
  :method:`WsfPlatformPart <WsfPlatformPart.DeleteAuxData>` and :method:`WsfTrack <WsfTrack.DeleteAuxData>`

* Added the :command:`event_output.print_track_residual_covariance` command to :command:`event_output`.

* Added numerous script methods to :class:`WsfArticulatedPart` and :class:`WsfSensor` to query the slewing, cueing, and
  scanning parameters.

* If a :command:`platform` does not have an :command:`platform.optical_signature` defined but does have the
  :command:`platform.length`, :command:`platform.width` and :command:`platform.height` attributes defined, the values of those
  attributes and the current viewing angle to compute an optical cross section.

* Added script methods to :class:`WsfLocalTrack`: :method:`WsfLocalTrack.RawTracksFrom`,
  :method:`WsfLocalTrack.RawTrackFromSensorName`, and :method:`WsfLocalTrack.RawTrackFromSensorType`

* Added script methods to :class:`WsfSensor`: :method:`SelectEP_Technique <WsfSensor.SelectEP_Technique>` and
  :method:`DeselectEP_Technique <WsfSensor.DeselectEP_Technique>`

* Added the ability to turn off verbose information about fire and detonate PDUs to the console through the
  :command:`dis_interface.debug_warfare_pdu` input to the DIS interface.

* Added user-defined scripts to :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR`: :command:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR.on_task_assign_sent`,
  :command:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR.on_task_complete_sent`, :command:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR.on_task_cancel_sent`.

* **(CR 8922)** Added a :method:`WsfMessage.DataTag` field to messages which can be used to track the progress of
  certain types of data (tracks and images in particular) as they are sent over communications networks. There was no
  easy provision to do this if the object was forwarded from platform-to-platform via using processes other than the
  normal communications relay and routing (e.g.: using the track reporting provided by :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`).

* **(CR 8939)** Enhanced track error effects in :model:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT`. Errors in range, azimuth, elevation, and
  velocity can be applied to a track. Errors can be walked off at a linear rate, if the required J-to-S is met, until a
  holdout point, and then optionally recycled.

* **(CR 8940)** Add provisions to :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT` to operate and handle the effects of the :model:`WSF_POL_MOD_EFFECT`
  and its :model:`polarization_switching_rate <WSF_POL_MOD_EFFECT>`.

* **(CR 8941)** Add provisions to dynamically set the priority of a message. Added script methods
  :method:`WsfMessage.Priority` and :method:`WsfMessage.SetPriority` to get and set the message priority. Added the ability to
  define the script :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.on_message_create` which will get called by certain processors after a
  message is created internally but before it is sent.

* **(CR 8947)** Implemented the :command:`channel_partition_protocol <comm>` frequency division multiple access (FDMA)
  capability. Users can now set the number of channels per comm device using 'number_of_channels' (defaults is
  1 channel).

* **(CR 8948)** Implemented the :command:`channel_partition_protocol <comm>` time division multiple access (TDMA)
  capability. Users can now set the number of channels per comm device using 'number_of_channels' (defaults is
  1 channel).

* Added the ability to define a :command:`WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR.filter` for a :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR` operating in
  independent mode.

* **(CR 8953)** Added the :method:`WsfImage.CollectionFactor` to :class:`WsfImage`, which for a SAR sensor will return the
  ratio of the desired azimuth resolution divided by the achieved azimuth resolution.

* **(CR 8954)** Modified :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR` to use the track quality of the constituent sensors as as guide
  when determining if a track report should be used updating the composite track. This prevents a lower quality report
  from updating the composite track if the track is being updated by a higher quality reported.

* **(CR 8957)** Added in a jamming to signal (J/S) table into the :model:`WSF_POWER_EFFECT`.

* Added the ability for :command:`horizontal_map` to produce contour plots of detection probability in
  :command:`KML (Keyhold Markup Language) <horizontal_map.kml_file>`
  and :command:`ESRI shapefile <horizontal_map.shapefile>` format.

* **(CR 8962)** Added in random calculation for false targets for the :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` and allowed
  connection to the :command:`false_target_screener` to get the track capacity for the maximum false target capacity in this
  effect.

* **(CR 8985)** Added in a new :model:`WSF_COVER_PULSE_EFFECT`.

* **(CR 9008)** Added in the capability to allow for
  :command:`electronic_warfare_effect.target_protection_type` (e.g. self-protect or non-self-protect).
  Also added in the capability to :command:`allow <electronic_warfare_effect.allowed_target_set>` and/or
  :command:`reject <electronic_warfare_effect.rejected_target_set>` targets for the application of jamming EA effects and jamming
  power.

* Added the ability to specify slew rates for :command`_.articulated_part.azimuth_slew_rate` and
  :command:`sensor_mode.azimuth_cue_rate`.

* Added the ability to define :model:`number_of_false_targets <WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT>` to the
  :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT`.

* **(CR 9041)** Added the :command:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR.rescale_substandard_image` command to :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` to control
  if a substandard image (i.e.: one whose collection time was not sufficient to achieve the desired azimuth resolution)
  will be rescaled to maintain the aspect ratio that would have existed if the collection time was completed.

* Added the :method:`WsfSimulation.CreatePlatform` and :method:`WsfSimulation.AddPlatform` script methods to
  :class:`WsfSimulation`. These methods provide a simpler interface for spawning off or dynamically creating platforms during
  a simulation.

* Added :command:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR.mode.maximum_range_rate` and :command:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR.mode.minimum_range_rate` commands
  to :model:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR`.

* Added group-based reporting via the :command:`_.External_Link_Commands.report_to_group` command -- an alternative to
  command chains.

* Added :command:`_.receiver.check_terrain_masking` command to :command:`_.receiver`.

* Added :command:`group.aux_data` input for groups.

* **(CR 9089)** Refactored some of the :ref:`antenna_pattern.esa_pattern` previously steered_array_pattern
  to allow for software inheritance of this class and to extend this into other types of ESA patterns.

* Added WsfTime script class, as a script representation of date and time.  It exposes many of the methods of
  the UtCalendar class.

* **(CR 9102)** The surface-to-surface mode of :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` will first attempt to use
  the location from the target track, and if that is not present will use the location of the truth platform contained in
  the track (if it is present). This eliminates the need to construct a pseudo-platform at the desired impact location.

* Added filtering options to the :command:`dis_interface` to filter out entity states.  These options are
  :command:`dis_interface.ignore_kind_and_domain`, :command:`dis_interface.ignore_type`, and
  :command:`dis_interface.filter_out_by_range`.  When all entity states are filtered for a given DIS entity,
  the corresponding external platform will not appear in the simulation.

* Added in a new :class:`WsfEW_Effects` scripting object type, use by accessing from :class:`WsfEM_Interaction` script.

* **(CR 9153)** Added :class:`WsfDraw` script method :method:`BeginEllipsoid <WsfDraw.BeginEllipsoid>` with parameters for
  heading, pitch, roll, and the 3 radii defining the semi-principal axes. Also added an alias
  :method:`BeginSphere <WsfDraw.BeginSphere>` and :method:`BeginCircle <WsfDraw.BeginCircle>` (an alias for
  :method:`BeginEllipse <WsfDraw.BeginEllipse>`), which take a single radius.

* **(CR 9182)** Added script methods to :class:`WsfFuel` (:method:`ConsumptionRate <WsfFuel.ConsumptionRate>`,
  :method:`SetConsumptionRate <WsfFuel.SetConsumptionRate>`, :method:`BingoQuantity <WsfFuel.BingoQuantity>`,
  :method:`SetBingoQuantity <WsfFuel.SetBingoQuantity>`, :method:`ReserveQuantity <WsfFuel.ReserveQuantity>`, and
  :method:`SetReserveQuantity <WsfFuel.SetReserveQuantity>`).

* **(CR 9183)** Enhanced :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` to allow :model:`thrust <WSF_GUIDED_MOVER>` and
  :model:`fuel burn rate <WSF_GUIDED_MOVER>` to be defined using tables that are a function of time.

* Added the capability for the :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` to report
  :model:`bearing-elevation <WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR>` data in its output tracks, instead of location
  data.  This feature is currently incompatible with filtering options.

* Added a :model:`jam_strobe_detector <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` capability to the :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.

* Added in the capability to define a :command:`_.platform_part.debug_level` for platform parts. Allows
  for limiting and controlling the debug information displayed to standard output. Currently only implemented for
  :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`, :model:`WSF_OTH_RADAR_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER`. More capability to be added to inheriting
  platform parts in future releases.

* **(CR 9250)** Added in :command:`radar_signature.bistatic_signature` to :command:`radar_signature` to define
  bistatic signature tables for platform_types.

* Modified :command:`sensor_plot_flight_path_analysis <flight_path_analysis>` so the analysis will be performed
  considering the target platform against all the other platforms, rather than considering the all the other sensors
  versus the target. (See :command:`flight_path_analysis.reverse_evaluations`).

* Added MOVER_UPDATED callback to the script :command:`observer` interface.

* Added the :command:`zone.reference_platform` to :command:`zone` definitions.
