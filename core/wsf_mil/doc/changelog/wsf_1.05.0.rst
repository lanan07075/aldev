WSF 1.5.0 - 10-Dec-2008
-----------------------

Enhancements
============

These optional interfaces are not included in the standard unclassified release.

* Added the mover **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** and the processor **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**. These are significant
  enhancements to :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` respectively, and have many new capabilities that
  allow them to model weapons that could not be modeled with the old capabilities. These are not yet documented, but are
  being included to allow testing by a few users.

  .. note::

      For now WSF_GUIDED_MOVER and WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER have synonyms of WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER and
      WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER respectively. If you wish to continue to use the old capabilities you should change to use
      the 'WSF_OLD\_' forms as the new forms will eventually be renamed to become the default versions.

* Added the :command:`antenna_pattern steered_array_pattern <antenna_pattern>` antenna gain pattern
  generator which provides increased fidelity in representing systems that utilize electronically steered arrays (ESA).

* Added capability to :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>` :command:`antenna_plot` to to choose a pattern
  by frequency and or polarization  via the :command:`antenna_plot.frequency` and
  :command:`antenna_plot.polarization` inputs.

* Added capability to :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>` :command:`antenna_plot` to handle
  electronically steered antenna patterns via
  :command:`antenna_plot.electronic_beam_steering`,
  :command:`antenna_plot.electronic_beam_steering_loss_exponent`,
  :command:`antenna_plot.azimuth_steering_angle`,
  :command:`antenna_plot.elevation_steering_angle` inputs.

* Added a coherent jamming power implementation to complement the noise jamming power implementation for
  :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER`. The coherent jamming power **will not** be used in the sensor signal-to-noise calculations since it
  is coherent and is seen as signal (not noise) by the sensor. The coherency of the jamming power is determined by the
  applied :command:`electronic_attack` effect that is applied to the sensor's receiver.

* Added a pulse jamming power implementation to complement the noise and coherent jamming power implementation for
  :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER`. The pulse jamming power **will** be used in the sensor signal-to-noise calculations since it is
  non-coherent and is seen as noise by the sensor. No output is provided currently to differentiate between pulse jamming
  power and noise jamming power, as they are summed together in the :command:`event_output` log.

* **(CR 6020)** Added the :command:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.post_lockon_detection_threshold_adjustment` and
  :command:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.post_lockon_adjustment_delay_time` to :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` for compatibility with SUPPRESSOR's
  POST-LOCKON-THRESHOLD and POST-LOCKON-S/N-DELAY commands.

* Added :class:`WsfDraw` script class allowing users to insert drawing commands in the DIS output stream.

* Added the :command:`dis_interface.suppress_non_standard_data` command to the :command:`dis_interface`.

* Added :model:`WSF_RPJ_EFFECT`, which is a Random Pulse Jamming (RPJ) effect extension to the
  :command:`Electronic Attack (EA) <electronic_attack>` capabilities.

* Added :model:`WSF_PULSE_SUPPRESS_EFFECT`, which is a pulse suppression effect extension to the
  :command:`Electronic Protect (EP) <electronic_protect>` capabilities.

* Added the :command:`WSF_WEAPON_TRACK_PROCESSOR.uplink_required` command to :model:`WSF_WEAPON_TRACK_PROCESSOR` to indicate
  if an uplink is always required for the weapon.

* Added the **guide_to_truth** command to :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER <WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER>` and
  :model:`WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER <WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER>` to allow a weapon to guide reasonably when the
  source of the guidance information is of very low fidelity.

* Added script string methods StartsWith(string) and EndsWith(string). Each return a boolean allowing a string to be
  tested against a beginning or ending substring.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6019)** Corrected a problem where, under certain rarely occurring conditions, the azimuth beam pointing
  angle was being corrupted if the angle exceeded the maximum azimuth slewing limit.

* **(CR 6021)** Corrected a problem where the beam pointing angle for tracking sensors was slightly off. Incorrect
  pointing could cause a loss of a couple of dB if the beam was very narrow which might cause failed detections at long
  ranges.

* **(CR 6041)** Corrected a problem where the SENSOR_DETECTION_CHANGED events for a given sensor/target pair were
  not toggling between detecting and not detecting as they should. The transition to not detecting was not being caught
  if the sensor was tracking the target at that time.

* **(CR 6044)** Corrected a problem where some SENSOR_TRACK_INITIATED events from event_output contained strange
  data. The problem was traced to :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` during its processing of a SAR image. The calls that produced
  the messages were removed because they really were not pertinent and could cause other problems. Alternative ways of
  conveying the data will be evaluated when the image processing framework is updated in the future.

* **(CR 6075)** - Corrected a problem where the atmospheric attenuation for a 1-way path should have been 1/2 (in db
  terms) of the 2-way path involving the same two objects. The error was small a short ranges, but became more apparent
  at longer ranges (about 10% at 250 km)

* Corrected a problem where a program would quit unexpectedly when reading an invalid IR10T.
  An error message now provides a clue to origin of the problem.

* Corrected a problem where IR10T tables were required to be 0-360&deg; in azimuth.  Now
  0-180&deg; azimuth tables are correctly handled as symmetric.
