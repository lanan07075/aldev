.. _wsf_1.7.0:

WSF 1.7.0 - 13 Dec 2010
-----------------------

General
=======

* :ref:`As documented in previous release notes <wsf_1.7.5>`, :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` and
  :model:`WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER` will now refer to the new implementations. To continue utilizing the old implementations you
  must change your weapon definitions to use :model:`WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` and
  :model:`WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER`. Note that the scenarios released with the WSF distribution have already been updated as
  necessary. Scenarios that used the explicit **WSF_NEW_** and **WSF_OLD_** forms will work as in previous releases. Use
  of the **WSF_OLD_** forms should not be used for new work.

* Updated :ref:`MTT` (re-coded in C/C++) to Suppressor version 7.0071 (only for builds that
  include MTT).

* The :ref:`Reactive Integrated Planning Architecture <RIPR>` (RIPR) is now compiled into the baseline sage
  executable.  The open source SOAR module must still be compiled separately.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 8280)** Corrected an issue where the CSIMS missile model would generate missile state
  data with 'not-a-number' (or NaN) values if the target was already dead at the time the missile was launched.
  (Classified releases only)

* **(CR 8316)** Corrected an issue with multi-beam radars interacting with false target jamming. When more than one
  beam is interacting with the same jammer transmitter and one of the beams does not pass a power sufficiency test it
  fails to interact with all subsequent beams unless it then interacts with another beam. The last beam in wins the
  interaction pass/fail criteria. With this fix when a single beam can interact it adds it to the interactions list.

* **(CR 8317)** Fixed some issues with false target jamming causing segmentation faults when doing a multi-threaded
  simulation run.

* **(CR 8365)** The velocities are now reported as feet/second per the standard in the j11.1 message.

* **(CR 8372)** The :class:`WsfMessage` script functions :method:`SetSizeInBits <WsfMessage.SetSizeInBits>` and
  :method:`SetSizeInBytes <WsfMessage.SetSizeInBytes>` were not working causing a runtime error.

* **(CR 8382)** Fixed a problem with road mover platforms instantaneously changing altitude when paused.

* **(CR 8397)** Corrected a problem where crash would occur if a DIS Detonation PDU was received where the target
  was not specified or not existent **and** the 'Location' field in the PDU was zero.

* **(CR 8454)** The **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** now responds to the base set of platform mover script commands, such as
  TurnToHeading(), GoToAltitude(), and GoToSpeed(). Corrected a problem in **WSF_6DOF_MOVER** that caused inconsistent
  kinematic data to be reported. When flying straight a level at a constant speed, the position reported at time T2 did
  not match the position computed by extrapolating from the previously reported state at time T1.

* **(CR 8471)** Updated the :ref:`antenna_pattern.cosecant_squared_pattern` antenna pattern generator to reflect the
  most recent updates from the source code from which this routine was derived. The original source erroneously used the
  azimuth_beamwidth to compute the elevation-dependent gain above and below the cosecant-squared region. The code with
  now use the elevation_beamwidth when computing the elevation-dependent gain in these regions. Note that this MAY cause
  some differences in the resulting pattern outside of the cosecant-squared region.

* **(CR 8475)** The jamming effects models :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT` and :model:`WSF_RPJ_EFFECT` were computing a
  incorrect pulse density because they were using an integrated pulse count that had been internally adjusted by the
  radar. The models have now been modified to use the unadjusted pulse count.

* **(CR 8576)** The :command:`track_manager` was immediately purging a local track when the last correlated raw track was
  dropped even though a :model:`track processor <WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR>` with a :command:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR.purge_interval` was
  defined. The documentation states that if a purge_interval is defined then tracks will only be dropped during the
  periodic purging.

* **(CR 8582)** :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` was modified so that detections of intermittent communications signals extended
  through all samples in which the message was being transmitted. Formerly it only reported the detection during the
  sample in which the message started being transmitted.

* **(CR 8584)** Corrected the problem where the :command:`horizontal_map.detection_reference` command in the
  :command:`horizontal_map` and :command:`sensor_plot_flight_path_analysis <flight_path_analysis>` functions
  of :command:`sensor_plot` was being not recognized. It was inadvertently deleted in an update for the 1.6.4 release.

* **(CR 8592)** Corrected a problem where enabling incidental damage in a :command:`weapon_effects` definition was not resulting in targets being destroyed when they should have.

* **(CR 8615)** Corrected a problem where excessive memory would be allocated if multiple :command:`road_traffic` instances
  used the same :command:`route_network`. If the networks were large there was a possibility the simulation would fail during
  initialization with an out-of-memory condition.

Enhancements
============

* **(CR 7988)** Added Property Data Accessor Methods to :class:`WsfMover`.

* Added :class:`WsfVisualization` script class to allow changing platform visibility on VESPA, and manipulating animated
  models.

* **(CR 8116)** Modified :model:`WSF_SAM_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` launch computer type.  Adds track lateral offset as an
  independent variable.  The implementation chooses the closest available offset set from which to compute a
  range/time-of-flight firing solution.  Corresponding modifications were also made to weapon_tools for Launch Computer
  generation.

* **(CR 8369)** Added capability to enter spot SAR size (height,width) as inputs. The values are used to adjust FOV
  during spot (:model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR`).

* **(CR 8350)** Added in a new repeater jamming effect, :model:`WSF_REPEATER_EFFECT`,  that can be applied to modify the
  gain thresholds of the jamming power based on different methods.

* **(CR 8377)** Added the capability to limit the number of tracks that are reported by a :command:`sensor` when a
  :command:`false_target_screener` is present on it. The new capability will limit or stop sending tracks based on the
  :command:`false_target_screener.allow_track_reporting_when_flooded` command.

* **(CR 8422)** Added the :command:`event_output.print_failed_message_delivery_attempts` and
  :command:`event_output.print_failed_sensor_detection_attempts` commands to :command:`event_output`.

* Updated the *csims_interface* missile model (for classified releases only) to correspond to the SIMS
  1.33.2 model as released with SUPPRESSOR.

* Allow redefinition of :command:`platform.commander` and :command:`platform.geo_point` in a :command:`platform`. This facilitates
  reuse of existing scenarios for testing or other studies which may require changes in the reporting structure.

* **(CR 8380)** Added indication that DTED directory is located and that at least one DTED sub-directory exists.

* **(CR 8442)** Added the :class:`WsfEM_Interaction` script class, the derived classes
  :class:`WsfSensorInteraction` and :class:`WsfCommInteraction`. Updated the script
  observers to use the new classes. This allows users to write script observers that extract results from sensor and
  communication interactions.

* **(CR 8445)** Added a default value of -999 to several :command:`sensor_plot` variables that did not have an initial
  value set.

* **(CR 8477)** Added the :command:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER.compute_end_point` command to
  :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`. This option will cause computation of the 'end point and time' of a
  ballistic missile interceptor, which is the estimated location and time at which the interceptor would hit the Earth's
  surface if it followed a ballistic trajectory and did not hit the intended target.

* **(CR 8504)** Added documentation for the :command:`sensor_plot` command
  :command:`sensor_plot_flight_path_analysis <flight_path_analysis>` function. Added the capability to use a
  Time-Space-Position-Information (TSPI) file or a platform with a route and sample interval as additional methods for
  providing the sample points.

* **(CR 8507)** Added infrastructure changes, primarily to WsfPlatformPart via ( :ref:`Platform_Part_Commands` ), to
  enable modeling damage to platforms at the individual part level.  Change will permit higher fidelity system
  degradation in response to Directed Energy or other part-targeted engagements.  This is a work-in-process, as platform
  part implementations must now query their damage state, and respond and/or "heal" appropriately.  A recovery time may
  now be supplied to queue an automatic Resurrect function to be called.

* Added in a method to degrade sensor updates in order to maintain realtime using the
  :command:`sensor_update_break_time` command. This command will cause the
  sensor updates for the current frame to stop after the currently updating sensors in each thread update. Since the
  sensor updates are done on a priority queue, the sensors priority in updating will be reevaluated the next sensor
  update frame.

* **(CR 8553)** Added in :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` to allow for a more simplistic way of modeling false targets that
  are only blocking detections/tracks.

* **(CR 8557)** Modified :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` to allow the optional selection of the
  :model:`probabilistic scan-on-scan (PSOS) <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>` model.

* Added the :ref:`attenuation_model.itu` atmospheric attenuation model as an option for determining RF atmospheric
  attenuation. The model includes the contribution for atmospheric gases (ITU-R P.676), and optional contributions from
  rain (ITU-R P.838) and fog and clouds (ITU-R P.840).

* Added the :ref:`attenuation_model.simple` atmospheric attenuation model as an option for determining RF
  atmospheric attenuation. This allows the specification as either a simple loss rate per unit length or a constant
  factor.

* **(CR 8577)** Added the sensor :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_SENSOR` which provides functionality similar to the 'compound'
  sensor found in EADSIM.

* Added the function :command:`spherical_map` to :command:`sensor_plot` to create plot files of target
  detectability at a specific range over a matrix of viewing angles.

Database Updates
================

* The classified scenarios were updated to reflect the data from ASC/ENDA as of July 2010. Extensive changes were
  made to the 'base_types' and 'site_types' to accommodate new tactics. Several things should be noted:

   * The way in which SAM launch computers were implemented is much different. In the long term it will be easier to add
     new weapons and change tactics without having to change a lot of files.

   * The tactics files have been moved from the 'platforms' to the 'processors' directory, and in some cases have been
     renamed. User-created scenarios that refer to the tactics files may have to have their 'include' paths updated.

   * The scenarios distributed with the classified release cannot be used with executables from previous releases. The
     new executables, however, can be used with older scenarios.

* **(CR 8591)** (Classified database) - Corrected problems in red_sag_assignment_tactics.txt where the
  'no-intercept-possible' condition was not getting handled, and the 'bestTime' variable was not getting properly updated.

* (Classified database) - Corrected a problem where the SA-15 battery commander was not turning on the local
  acquisition radar.

* (Classified database) - Corrected a problem where the relative yaw angle used for orienting the TTR system in a
  SAM battalion was being computed using the wrong platform as a reference. This was only a problem where the platform
  containing the TTR had a different heading than battalion commander platform (e.g.: as in the 'split' scenarios).

* (Classified database) - Corrected a problem where several of the tactical SAM systems were not working.
