WSF 1.6.3 - 30 Oct 2009
-----------------------

Corrections
===========

:command:`SOSM sensor installation_adjustment_table <_.sosm_sensor_model_commands.installation_adjustment_table>`

* **(CR 6915)** The file referenced by the :command:`SOSM sensor installation_adjustment_table 
  <_.sosm_sensor_model_commands.installation_adjustment_table>`
  command could not be opened if the file name was not an absolute file name.

* :command:`sensor_plot`:

  * **(CR 6903)** Fixed units for the 'radar_signature' and 'optical_signature' outputs in
    :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>` :command:`horizontal_map` and
    :command:`vertical_map` outputs.
  
  * **(CR 6926)** Fixed a segmentation fault when using steered_array patterns within sensor_plot that happened
    after the output file is created and program is closing.

* **(CR 6937)** Fixed a bug with the multi-access protocols (CSMA, ethernet, etc.) where a network would stop
  allowing transmissions at a random point in a scenario.

* **(CR 6970)** Fixed a bug that occurred when running in realtime and the CME other PDU not being sent.

* **(CR 6546)** Fixed a segmentation fault that would occur when declaring a container (Array or Map) if the
  variable name was missing (i.e. Array<int>; or Map<int, string>;).

* Fixed some issues in the :model:`WSF_FUSION_CENTER` where tracks were not being updated and removed properly.

Enhancements
============

* Added an additional form of WsfComm.SendUnicastMessage script method to allow a
  message to be directed to a platform with a specified name.

* Enhanced false-target capabilities for :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` with multiple beams. The logic will now select the
  beam with the greatest power and use it for the calculations, as opposed to taking the first beam with a detection.

* Moved the :command:`false_target_screener` definition block from being located on a :command:`_.receiver` to
  being located on a :command:`sensor` to allow for the roll-up of multiple beams radar sensors into a single result for each
  false-target interaction.

* False-target blip locations/altitudes are now along the beam center. This altitude is especially important for
  multi-beam radars/sensors that have altitude reporting capabilities.

* :command:`sensor_plot`:

  * **(CR 6904)** Added '**detection_threshold**' output for a minimum detectable signal level in
    :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>` :command:`horizontal_map` and
    :command:`vertical_map` outputs.

* **(CR 6904)** Added '**noise_power**' output to output the receiver noise in :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>`
  :command:`horizontal_map` and :command:`vertical_map` outputs.
  
  * **(CR 6904)** Added '**noise_jammer_power**', '**pulse_jammer_power**', '**coherent_jammer_power**',
    '**noise_jammer_to_signal**', '**pulse_jammer_to_signal**', '**coherent_jammer_to_signal**' and
    '**coherent_jammer_to_noise**'  outputs in :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>` :command:`horizontal_map`
    and :command:`vertical_map` outputs.
  
  * **(CR 6911)** Added target-to-sensor geometry outputs similar to the sensor-to-target geometry output methods
    in :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>` :command:`horizontal_map` output.
  
  * Added pixel_count variable option to :command:`sensor_plots's <sensor_plot>`
    :command:`horizontal_map` output.

* **(CR 6949)** Added script methods :method:`Seed <Math.Seed>` and :method:`SetSeed <Math.SetSeed>` methods to :class:`MATH <Math>` script
  variable to access and set the current seed.

* Added in more debug output for outputting calculated values during initialization of the
  :command:`antenna_pattern steered_array_pattern <antenna_pattern>`.

* Added **flight_path_angle**, **target_flight_path_angle** and **on_commanded_flight_path_angle** as a phase-change
  criteria that can be checked by **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**.

* Added :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` that uses a user generated surface-to-surface_table or
  surface-to-air_table for ballistic impacts or intercepts. These tables are generated with the
  :command:`BALLISTIC_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR` (part of :command:`weapon_tools`) to determine initial trajectory launch angle for the
  desired impact point.  In addition, divert_thrust, divert_fuel_mass, and divert_fuel_flow_rate was added to the
  **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** for ballistic terminal intercepts.

* False-target tracks are now processed with the :command:`track_manager` perfect correlation scheme. The
  :command:`track_manager` for the most part seems to be working properly with false-targets as designed.

* Added the :command:`dis_interface.suppress_cme_draw_data` command to the :command:`dis_interface` block that allows users to
  suppress DIS PDUs generated through the WsfDraw interface.

* The :command:`false_target_screener` will allow a real target to be tracked that has a range from the sensor that is less
  than that of the closest false target. This behavior is default in the functionality of the :command:`false_target_screener`.

* Added inputs to allow for the forcing target tracks in the :command:`false_target_screener` given a set of criteria using
  :command:`false_target_screener.force_target_tracks` input block data items. The methods allow for forcing
  a target track based on range constraining of the blips and the target track location being outside of those
  constrained limits, also forcing is allowed for a given sector around the target track location not having a maximum
  number of false targets present.

* Can now report PW and PRI of a detected signal for :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` by setting the '**
  reports_pulse_repetition_interval**' and '**reports_pulsewidth**' in the :command:`sensor`
  :ref:`sensor_track_information_reporting_commands`.

* Added :class:`WsfTrack` script :ref:`Signal Methods <WsfTrack.Signal_Methods>` to get the :ref:`PRI <WsfTrack.Signal_Methods>`
  and :ref:`PW <WsfTrack.Signal_Methods>` of the detected emitter.

* **(CR 6996)** Modified :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` so they issue
  :ref:`docs/event/sensor_events:SENSOR_DETECTION_CHANGED` events whenever a transition between detectability and
  non-detectability occurs for a specific platform.

* **(CR 6997)** Added the :command:`platform.navigation_errors` block to :command:`platform` to allow
  introduction of errors resulting from differences in where a platform believes itself to be located and where it is
  actually located.

* Added :command:`route.time_to_point` route command.

* **(CR 7002)** Added the :command:`antenna_pattern.gain_adjustment_table` to :command:`antenna_pattern` to
  allow the resulting gain to be scale by the signal frequency. Also added a scalar
  :command:`antenna_pattern.gain_adjustment` command to allow simple scaling.
