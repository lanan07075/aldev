WSF 1.6.2 - 13 Aug 2009
-----------------------

General
=======

* The source has been updated to compile with the GNU GCC 4.4.0 compilers.

* This release incorporates the initial implementation of the :command:`Spectral Optical Sensing Model (SOSM) <sosm_interface>`.
  This is a spectral infrared detection model that is intended to eventually replace the
  10-table IR model in **WSF_IR10T_SENSOR**.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6785)** Corrected an issue with :command:`false_target` blips being displayed when they shouldn't be due to poor SNR. Also corrected an issue where a noise jammer that was also impinging upon a radar that was receiving :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT` (i.e. :command:`false_target` blips) was not factoring in the noise jamming signal properly to the SNR calculation for each blip.

* **(CR 6789)** Modified the weapon engagement model to allow the weapon model to explicitly provide a miss distance
  to be used in determining the probability-of-kill (Pk). Formerly the model would use the target and weapon platform
  locations to determine the miss distance, which could be significantly different if the weapon model was running with a
  fixed time step and the intercept was declared to occur in the middle of a timestep. This affected
  *jaam_interface* in particular because that model only provided the miss distance at intercept and not the
  locations at intercept. Therefore, the locations one timestep past intercept were being used for determining miss
  distance and Pk, which could be sufficiently different so a to cause a miss to be declared when the weapon model
  declared a hit.  A new command (jaam_interface *use_jaam_miss_distance*) toggles this behavior.

* **(CR 6792)** Fixed an issue where subsequent jamming interactions would fail after the first one was processed
  for a target detection attempt.

* **(CR 6542)** Corrected the sensor track updating process so the track validity flags now reflect the
  :ref:`sensor_track_information_reporting_commands` for the mode that most recently updated the track.
  Formerly the validity flags would only represent the reporting flags for the mode that caused the track to be created.

* **(CR 6805)** Corrected problems with the new movers related to:

  * Routes with 1 point for movers other than WSF_AIR_MOVER.

  * Skipped points in routes with very low radial accelerations.

  * Usage of GoToAltitude() / GoToSpeed() while staying on route.

* **(CR 6817)** The current pointing angles for :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` were not getting published to DIS, so the beam
  was not being displayed correctly by VESPA if emitter edges or faces was turned on.

Enhancements
============

* **(CR 5847)** Modified :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` so it will detect intermittent signals properly. Formerly a radio
  frequency :command:`comm` device that was on would always be reported as being detected even though it was not transmitting a
  message. The sensor will now only report a signal as being present for a comm device only when a message was
  transmitted during for the sample interval.

  The :command:`comm.transmit_mode` command was added to :command:`comm` to declare if the device transmits
  intermittently or continuously. The default is intermittent.

* Modified :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` so it will report all detected frequency bands from complex targets such as a multi-beam radar.

* Added new route mover commands: :model:`on_turn_failure <WSF_AIR_MOVER>` and :model:`turn_failure_threshold <WSF_AIR_MOVER>`.

* Added several new features to **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** to support dynamic control of guidance parameters:

   * Added the ability to test script variables in next_phase commands.

   * Added script methods to allow changing of commanded altitude and speed.

* Added a script interface to phase 2 initialization of objects. on_initialize is called when first initializing a platform component and on_initialize2 is called after every component has completed phase 1 initialization.

* Added methods to access the :class:`mover's <WsfMover>` route and default route in script.

* Added :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` that provides the capability to classify and/or identify all platforms in the image or video based on the number of pixels the platform takes up and Johnson Criteria equations.

* Added the **event_csvoutput** command that provides the ability to create pre-defined comma delimited log files that can be read directly into spreadsheet programs without having to pre-process standard event log files or writing user defined scripts with the :command:`observer` command.
