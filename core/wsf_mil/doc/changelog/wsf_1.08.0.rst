WSF 1.8.0 - 12 Dec 2013
-----------------------

General
=======

* The 'reports_spatial_domain' input, which had been an option in the sensor mode to set all tracks to the given
  spatial domain, is now deprecated.  This input had been used as a work-around for providing a spatial domain.  It is
  being removed both because the work-around is no longer necessary and because the meaning can be misinterpreted as an
  option for the sensor to report tracks of the given domain.  Instead, to select reported tracks by domain one should
  use the :command:`sensor.ignore_domain` input.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 9265)**  Track processors will now recognize and process local tracks updates from other track processors
  that are internally linked.

* **(CR 10316)** Fixed a problem in the :ref:`Sensor_Plot_Horizontal_Map` function, where
  the orientation of the maps in downrange / crossrange format were incorrectly rotated.

* **(CR 10328)** Fixed an input processing problem with :command:`radar_signature.bistatic_signature`
  that have multiple frequencies.

* **(CR 10449)**  :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` now reports the emitter types in its associated tracks, along with a listing of
  the signal indexes that make up the :class:`WsfTrack`. The methods to access emitter data are defined in
  :ref:`Emitter Methods <WsfTrack.Emitter_Methods>`. Access to this list is similar to the current
  :ref:`Signal Methods <WsfTrack.Signal_Methods>`.
  The :model:`reported_emitter_type <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>` is used to define how the emitter type is reported.

* **(CR 10481)** If a :command:`weapon` has a :command:`weapon.firing_interval` larger than a :command:`weapon.salvo_interval` no
  longer causes subsequent weapons in a fired salvo to fail.  The larger interval is used.

* **(CR 10522)** Fixed a problem where the waypoint movers (WSF_AIR_MOVER, WSF_GROUND_MOVER, etc...) would not
  respect the maximum speed or altitude mover parameters when processing the first point of a route.

* Fixed an issue with the jamming perceptions on Sensors and Comms using the jamming power after many of the
  Electronic Warfare Effects were applied causing it to incorrectly think that there was/wasn't jamming perceived.

* Fixed an issue in the WsfTrackManager where deletions from the raw track list and filtered raw track list, during
  track purges, were causing a very intermittent problem.  This was due to the fact that the WsfTrackId was being used as
  a parameter to delete a filtered raw track, but this parameter became invalid, because it was part of the already
  deleted raw track.

* Fixed an issue where the :model:`WSF_STATE_MACHINE` processor's variable 'STATE_MACHINE' was always null.

* Corrected an issue in :command:`sensor_plot` :command:`sensor_plot.horizontal_map` where when using an ESM sensor
  as the plotting sensor to detect a radar with a :model:`maximum_request_count  <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`
  greater than 0 the sensor would not interact (i.e. detect) the radar. Issue was with an internal listener interface
  that queues the ESM detections for tracking type radars during the track radar's detection attempt instead of through
  the ESM systems normal detection process.

* Corrected a problem where global spherical zones did not work.

* Fixed a couple issues with how the :class:`WsfRouteFinder` handled impossible routes (completely blocked or perhaps the
  target location inside of an avoidance region).  Added SetMaxArcLength() method which breaks up long portions of a turn
  on the route provided with several waypoints along the arc.

Enhancements
============

* Added :ref:`Auxiliary Data Methods <WsfTask.Auxiliary_Data_Methods>` to the :class:`WsfTask` object.

* Added :command:`noise_cloud`.  This feature will generate fractal noise clouds that may be used to attenuate sensor and
  comm signals.

* Moved the :command:`behavior_tree` feature to the :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR` processors.  A :command:`behavior` is defined
  'globally' at the simulation level and is unique by name.

   * The syntax for attaching behavior nodes to a :command:`behavior_tree` is changed, you now use "behavior_node
     <name>" instead of "behavior <name> end_behavior".

   * Now all processors that derive from the :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR` can use behavior trees, including the
     :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` and the :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR`.

   * The script block ":model:`query_bid_type <WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR>`" is specific to :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR` and no
     longer valid when defined inside of a behavior.  All example agents and training modules have been updated accordingly.

   * The "PROCESSOR" variable for behavior script defaults to a :class:`WsfProcessor`.  You can cast the variable to a
     different processor type if you attach the behavior to a behavior_tree on a processor derived from script processor.

* When editing a behavior, at the processor level, now all behaviors of the given name on that processor's behavior
     tree are edited not just the first one of that name found.

* Added finite state machines to the :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR <WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR>`

   * Any state in the state machine can have its own behavior_tree which is processed when the state is evaluated.

* Added the new :model:`WSF_PERCEPTION_PROCESSOR` processor.  It provides a cognitive model of threat and asset
  perception.

   * The new :class:`WsfAssetPerception` object can be obtained from the :class:`WsfPerceptionProcessor` or from the owning
     :ref:`WsfPlatform <WsfPlatform.Perception_Methods>`.

* Added the new :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` processor.  It provides more access to the various steps of
  coordinated optimal tasking. Compatible with existing WSF_TASK_MANAGER processors, e.g. it can send receive task
  messages.

* Added script methods to :class:`WsfPlatform` and :class:`WsfWeapon` for weapon status, for example:

   * int WeaponsActiveFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)
   * WsfPlatformList ActiveWeaponPlatformsFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

* Added :class:`WsfMover` script SetTSPI_FileName(), to assist with run-time replacement of TSPI trajectory data files.

* Added WsfObserver callback (and the Event Output logging) for MOVER_STAGED and MOVER_BURNED_OUT.

* Updated :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` by adding the ability to switch phases upon obtaining autonomous sensor track of
  the target.  Requires "next_phase when sensor_track_established" sequence in a phase...end_phase definition block.

* Added Observable event PlatformCapabilityChanged.  This event indicates when a platform gains or loses the ability
  to supply ammunition, fuel, vehicle recovery, vehicle repair, or automatic dependent surveillance broadcast.  A word is
  contained within DIS Entity State PDUs that enumerate the abilities just mentioned, and the mapped word bits provide
  Boolean values that can be examined for changes.  The event output item PLATFORM_CAPABILITY_CHANGED is also attached to
  this event, to log such transitions.

* Changed :model:`WSF_DIRECTION_FINDER_PROCESSOR`. Added field filter_bypass, which allows bypassing the Kalman filter.
  This makes the output simply the triangulation intersection points.  Also added field maximum_time_difference, to allow
  adjusting which non-synchronous measurements should be fused.  A high value, defaults to the original operation for
  stationary targets.  Changed the diverge-bearing gate, to allow more measurements to fuse.

* Added :command:`conditional_section` to conditionally include or exclude inputs.

* Added new class WsfMTI_TableManager.  It contains some functionality previously in WsfRadarSensor. In
  WsfRadarSensor, extracted MTI Table inner class into new WsfMTI_TableManager.  Generally renamed gmti to more general
  mti.  Also added a feature to allow specify an external MTI table in csv format (speed vs attenuation).

* Added script functions :class:`list_attr(), attr_count(), attr_name_at() <__BUILTIN__>` to enumerate an object's attributes.

* Added the command :command:`signal_processor.mti_adjustment.mti_maximum_range` to :ref:`signal_processor.mti_adjustment` which specifies a maximum range
  to be used with the MTI "tables" only. If the target is farther away, any MTI table will NOT be applied.

* Added a bi-static error model. Search command :ref:`error_model.bistatic_error`. The error
  model is based on paper "A Three-dimensional Bistatic Radar Target Position Measurement Error Model", R. K. Lynn.

* In :command:`sensor_plot`, added the capability to evaluate required_jamming_power in both vertical and horizontal maps
  now, instead of just horizontal.

* Added the capability to plot a :command:`spherical_map` with a fixed
  :command:`spherical_map.altitude` in lieu of the previous fixed range.

* Finalized the Sensor Plot :ref:`Sensor_Plot_Clutter_Table` generation feature, which was previously
  undocumented.

* Extended the :ref:`clutter_model.surface_clutter_table` feature to optionally utilize site
  specific information (as can be generated by :command:`Sensor Plot <clutter_table>`).

* Added :model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON` and the associated sensor, :model:`WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR`.  These had been in a separate
  library prior to this release.

* Reworked :model:`WSF_HEL_LETHALITY` so that effects can be specified by platform type, platform type and region, or
  category.   Each effect allows for a damage radius.  If no damage radius is specified, the energy and energy density
  are computed using the full width of the beam (usually, measured from the center to the point where intensity is 1/e).
  The legacy format is still supported, but it is deprecated.

* Added :command:`weapon_effects.on_target_damaged` and
  :command:`weapon_effects.on_target_killed` script options for :command:`weapon_effects`.  These scripts will
  override the default weapon effects behavior (to apply damage to the target platform and remove the target platform,
  respectively).  Thus, they are useful for applying nonstandard effects, such as destroying a sensor with a high-energy
  laser.

* Added the **default2** keyword to automatically configure DIS :command:`dis_interface.broadcast` and
  :command:`dis_interface.multicast` interfaces on a second network controller for machines with two network interface
  controllers.

* Added new module, optional project, wsf_helcomes, which provides the non-exportable
  helcomes fluence model.  This module allows interfacing WSF with the SAIC developed Army's
  tool called HELCoMES (High Energy Laser Consolidated Modeling and Engagement Simulation).  This interfaces utilizes JNI
  (Java Native Interface) and requires a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed to build and run.

* Added in the capability to :command:`sensor_plot` to output
  :ref:`jammer_to_mds <Sensor_Plot_Horizontal_Map>`

* Added in the capability to :command:`sensor_plot` to utilize a script to manipulate and output from the sensor detection
  data using the :ref:`Sensor_Plot_Horizontal_Map.Script_Variable` input commands and defining a script.

* Added a way to output :class:`WsfDraw` output to a separate :command:`draw_file` that can be loaded by the WSF_IDE.

* Added the ability to cause intentional stand-off-range fusing in the :model:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE` to detonate upon
  approach, prior to achieving point of closest approach.

* Added :model:`WSF_TOWED_MOVER <WSF_TOWED_MOVER>` to the Predefined Mover Types.  A platform with this type of mover is
  deployed by being launched from another platform.  The towed asset is reeled out at a specified rate for a specified
  distance, and then once deployed, it will follow the course of the lead platform.  The towed asset can be reeled back
  onto the lead platform by setting a reel in time and reel in rate.

* Added :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER <WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` to the Predefined Communications Types.  The
  communication system modifies constraints for communication-horizon limits in order to permit communications with
  platforms, such as submarines, that operate below the surface.

* Added support for :ref:`TADIL-J 2-0 <WsfTadilJ2_0I>` messages.

* Added a script access method to query threats from a :class:`WsfThreatProcessor`.

* Added two :command:`keywords <dis_interface>` options to set the orientation rate field in the DIS Entity State PDU.

Developer Items
===============

* The primary software build utility for WSF is now CMake.  The existing set of project files for Windows and make
  system and files for Linux will still operate, for unclassified builds only, for this release.  They will not be
  supported after this release, and developers are encouraged to migrate to CMake.

* Visual Studio 2012 builds are now supported.

* Visual Studio 2005 builds are no longer supported.

* Up-casting with UtScript is no longer allowed by default.
  `Upcasting example:   WsfMessage msg = xyz;  WsfTrackMessage trackMessage = (WsfTrackMessage)msg;`
  To enable upcasting for your type, you must either implement UtScriptClass::UpcastFromType() or set
  UtScriptClass::mIsScriptAccessible=true and inherit your application class from the UtScriptAccessible class AND
  implement GetScriptClassName().  Before this change, upcasting was unchecked and unsafe; upcasting is now safe, an
  upcast failure results in a 'null' script object but will not crash.
