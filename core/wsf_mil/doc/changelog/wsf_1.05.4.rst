WSF 1.5.4 - 7 April 2009
------------------------

General
=======

* A new implementation of the standard waypoint movers (:model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`,
  :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_MOVER`) are provided as an option in this release. The new implementation
  can be used in place of the existing implementation by defining the environment variable **WSF_NEW_MOVER** with a
  non-empty value prior to running your application.

  This is the final 1.5.x release and the new movers will remain an option for at least this release and the 1.6.0
  release. Pending no problems, the new movers will become the default with the 1.6.1 release. **It would be much
  appreciated if users would attempt to use the new movers and report any deficiencies.**

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6398)** Jamming corrections.

  * Fixed an issue with multi-beam radars interacting with :model:`false-targets <WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT>` caused a
    segmentation fault.
  
  * Fixed an issue with the :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER` interactions where secondary interactions gain patterns were incorrect.
  
  * Fixed an issue where the :command:`event_output` for :ref:`JAMMING_ATTEMPT` was incorrect.

  * **(CR 6451)** Corrected an issue where calling :method:`FollowRoute <WsfPlatform.FollowRoute>` after modifying route would
    cause the platform to stop moving.

* **(CR 6456)** Corrected an issue where corrupted DIS Electromagnetic Emission PDU's were being produced if a
  sensor was tracking a large number of entities and the :command:`dis_interface` command
  :command:`dis_interface.maximum_track_jam_entries` was specified with a small value (e.g.: 10). If the sensor tracked more
  objects than the specified maximum, a corrupted PDU would be produced occur when the number of objects tracked
  internally exceeded 255. It could also occur earlier with multi-beam radars.

* **(CR 6496)** Fixed an issue with :command:`weighted average fusion <track_manager.fusion_method>`, where in certain cases
  very small or zero entries in covariance matrices were causing a singular matrix exception and segmentation fault.

Enhancements
============

* **(CR 6352)** Enhanced the :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT` input commands to allow for defining different false-target
  effects and :command:`false_target` types to be defined for different system-types (i.e. sensors).

* **(CR 6483)** Added the :method:`SetAppearance <WsfPlatform.SetAppearance>` method to :class:`WsfPlatform` which allows
  modification of the DIS Entity State Appearance word (excluding bits 3-4,21 & 23).

* Added **transmit_antenna_gain** and **receive_antenna_gain** to the list of variables that can be selected in the
  :command:`horizontal_map` function of :command:`sensor_plot`.

* Added **print_track_covariance** as an option for track data output from then :command:`event_output`.  This new option
  prints the 2-D major and minor axes, and bearing in local NED coordinates, as well as printing out all values in the
  covariance matrix.

* **(CR 6438)** Added documentation for the previously undocumented scriptable simulation :command:`observer`, and added
  many new events for which a script observer can be provided. This capability allows analyst provided scripts to be
  called when certain events within the simulation occur to gather information as required for any platform interaction.
