WSF 1.7.1 - 25 Mar 2011
-----------------------

General
=======

Significant enhancements were made to the 'search' capability for the documentation provided with the software.
This should make it much easier to locate the desired information.

Updated the :command:`dis_interface` to set orientation rates to zero when using the
:command:`dis_interface.use_simple_accelerations` entry. To set the simple orientation rate fields in
the DIS Entity State PDU, use the entry :command:`dis_interface.use_simple_orientation_rates`,
also.  These commands will be ignored by any platform that has a 6-DOF mover, as the 6-DOF mover calculates its own
acceleration values.

Added a Flexible Data Link (FADL) communication module and Communication Effects interface.  The
FADL is a mechanism to represent data-link messages passed between simulated entities on a DIS network.  It has a
flexible definition to accommodate almost any message format.  One predefined message set has been defined in order to
achieve this interoperability to share target information.  The Communication Effects interface enables external
communications simulations to effect FADL traffic on a DIS network.

Corrections
===========

**(CR 8310)**  Fixed an issue where the J11.1 messages were being sent to a weapon when its target platform was no
  longer alive.  J11.1 messages are no longer being sent in this case to any weapons that had said platform as a target.

**(CR 8643)**  Fixed an issue where the number of canceled jammers was being incorrectly book-kept within the
   :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT` whenever the :command:`electronic_attack` being mitigated had multiple effects within a single
   technique and one of them was or inherited from the :model:`WSF_SLC_DEGRADE_EFFECT` with the number of saturated channels
   being greater than 1.

**(CR 8661)** Corrected an issue in weapon engagement termination processing where *csims_interface* and
   *jaam_interface* movers could cause a crash or lockup when running in multi-threaded mode.

**(CR 8662)** Corrected several memory initialization problems in the *WSF_CSIMS_MOVER* that
   would cause erratic flyouts on Windows 7 systems. The problem could have existed on any system, but was more pronounced
   on Windows 7 because of the way newly allocated memory was not initialized to zero.

**(CR 8663)**  Fixed a segmentation fault when the :model:`WSF_POL_MOD_EFFECT` and :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT` were interacting.
   This issue was not seen between the :model:`WSF_SLC_DEGRADE_EFFECT` and :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT`.

**(CR 8668)** Fixed a performance issue in the :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` causing slow/lock-ups in the simulation
   for sensors that scanned in azimuth and elevation with narrow beamwidths. Also fixed some issues with the algorithms
   and calculation of the number of false targets that the sensor could detect.

**(CR 8671)** Modified the :class:`WsfCovariance` script methods so they no longer require a track argument to be
   provided.

**(CR 8672)** Corrected a problem where later :command:`message_table` entries that used the same key (comm type, message
   type and message subtype) were not overwriting the values from the previous entry (thus violating the convention that
   the last value for a given data item should be used). Also modified the code so that a warning message would be emitted
   if a 'subtype' command was used under the 'default' command. The documentation did not indicate they were acceptable
   and the code would never use such entries.

**(CR 8673)** Fixed an issue where the :command:`dis_interface.ew_technique_type` command in the :command:`dis_interface` was
   only allowing 16-bit values when it should have allowed 32-bit values.

**(CR 8684)** Fixed issue where the :command:`dis_interface.start_entity` command in the :command:`dis_interface` did not
   work.

**(CR 8717)** Corrected a problem in the DIS Detonation PDU when a weapon platform is fully damaged and killed.
   The detonation result in the corresponding DIS Detonation PDU was being set to 5 (for detonation). It is now being set
   to 6 (for none) for this case.

**(CR 8723)** Corrected a problem where the azimuth component of a cue was getting used even if the
   :command:`_.articulated_part.slew_mode` or :command:`sensor_mode.cue_mode` specified 'elevation'.

**(CR 8724)** Corrected a problem where the orientation of a non-imaging sensor that was cued was not being
   properly reflected if there where no targets. This caused the visual displays in VESPA and the IWARS panel to be
   incorrect.

**(CR 8725)** Corrected a problem where when changing sensor modes, the scan rate (as computed from the
   :command:`sensor_mode.frame_time`) was not getting updated to the rate of the new mode.

**(CR 8726)** Corrected a problem where the sensor measurement errors for imaging sensors (:model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` and
   :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR`) were not getting propagated through image formation and analysis. This prevented the track manager
   from being able to compute a covariance matrix.

**(CR 8727)** Corrected a problem where :ref:`WSF_VIDEO_PROCESSOR` was not properly computing the velocity in the
   output tracks that represented the objects in the image. A change implemented in WSF 1.6.3 caused the problem.

**(CR 8738)** Corrected a problem where an additional space would show up after the first word in a script string
   in certain circumstances.

**(CR 8739)** Added behavior where track updates from the same raw track, at a lower track quality, are accepted
   for fusion.  These updates had been rejected because lower quality tracks, from any source, had been rejected.

**(CR 8743)** The script that converts IRIMAGE 'kio3' files into a format that can be used by the :ref:`SOSM_target_model_table`
   (kio3_to_sosm.pl) was aborting if every az/el sample did not include a plume contribution. It was
   corrected so it will produce a zero plume contribution for those az/el samples where no contribution was present in the
   'kio3' file.

**(CR 8758)** Documented the :class:`WsfTrack` script methods :method:`WsfTrack.IFF_Neutral` and
   :method:`WsfTrack.SetIFF_Neutral`.

**(CR 8760)** Corrected a problem in :command:`road_traffic` where the
   :command:`end_of_path_option reverse_direction <road_traffic.network.end_of_path_option>` was not working.

**(CR 8761)** Corrected a problem in :command:`road_traffic` where the initial distribution of travel times did not match
   the requested distribution.

**(CR 8793)** Corrected a cosmetic problem where the timestamp in the header written to :command:`dis_interface.record`
   was not correct. This was not a problem because the time used programs like **VESPA** was recorded in
   a different manner, but the timestamp was corrected just in case anybody ever used the file for another reason and
   expected the timestamps to be correct.

**(CR 8797)** Remove any special characters in user-supplied strings provided to :command:`event_output` before writing
   them to the event file. The presence of some special characters can prevent some post-processors from being able to
   interpret the file.

**(CR 8803)** Changed the default :command:`WSF_DELAY_PROCESSOR.number_of_servers` in :model:`WSF_DELAY_PROCESSOR` from '1'
   to 'infinite'. This makes it behave like a simple delay. The old default of '1' often caused problems because internal
   messages would interfere with the expected delay.

**(CR 8812)** Corrected a problem where the noise power used to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio was incorrect.
   The problem only occurred for comm interactions involving a :model:`WSF_RADIO_XMTR<WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` and a
   :model:`WSF_RADIO_RCVR<WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>`. It did not occur when using matched :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER`.

**(CR 8819)** Corrected a problem where :model:`WSF_GRADUATED_LETHALITY` was considering too many targets for possible
   damage when 'allow_incidental_damage' was enabled.

**(CR 8824)** The **target_pitch** and **target_roll** target state variable selection commands in :command:`sensor_plot`
   were not working because of a typographical error.

**(CR 8825)** Added documentation for the various :command:`sensor_plot` target state variable selection commands.

**(CR 8832, CR 8833)** Correct a problem where :model:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER` would sometimes generating the wrong route and
   using the wrong speed.

Enhancements
============

**(CR 5562)** Added the :command:`_.antenna_commands.scan_stabilization` option to enable the definition
   of 'stabilized' sensor scan volumes.

Added Ellipse capability to :class:`WsfDraw`.

Added alpha value to SetColor in :class:`WsfDraw` allowing lines and shapes to appear translucent.

Added documentation for :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`. This was implemented in the 1.7.0 release, but not
   documented.

Added script methods to WsfRoute: :method:`WsfRoute.Front`, :method:`WsfRoute.Back`, :method:`WsfRoute.Waypoint`

Added script methods to WsfWaypoint: :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetClimbRate`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.ClimbRate`,
   :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetLinearAcceleration`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.LinearAcceleration`,
   :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetRadialAcceleration`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.RadialAcceleration`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetAltitude`,
   :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetSwitch`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetSwitchTime`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetSwitchDistance`,
   :method:`WsfWaypoint.Switch`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.SetEndOfPathOption`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.Index`,
   :method:`WsfWaypoint.GoToLabel`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.Label`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.AltitudeAGL`, :method:`WsfWaypoint.AltitudeMSL`

Added script method :method:`WsfGeoPoint.SetAltitudeAGL` to WsfGeoPoint.

**(CR 8569)** Modified :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` so that it will report an object as being in the image even if the
   object was not detectable during part of the time while the image was being collected.

**(CR 8570)** Added the IMAGE_CREATED event to :command:`event_output`.

**(CR 8666)** Updated WSF to emit the latest format for the :class:`WsfDraw` PDUs, which support
    :ref:`layers <WsfDraw.Other_Methods>` and :ref:`ellipses <WsfDraw.Begin_Methods>`. Note: To use :class:`WsfDraw`
    with versions of VESPA v5.3.2 and
    older you must explicitly enable the deprecated :class:`WsfDraw` PDU format using the
    :command:`dis_interface.use_deprecated_cme_draw_data` command.

**(CR 8669)** Added methods to :method:`WsfTrack <WsfTrack.StateCovarianceAtTime>` and
   :class:`WsfCovariance` to return a covariance matrix that has been propagated forward in
   time. Also cleaned up the :class:`WsfCovariance` script methods to conform to the conventions for method names and return
   values.

**(CR 8674)** Added the capability to define Electronic Warfare (EW) sets, techniques and effect type definitions.
   See :command:`electronic_warfare`, :command:`electronic_warfare_technique` and :command:`electronic_warfare_effect` for more information.
   Also, with this capability is the capability to modify already defined EW types and instances.

**(CR 8698)** Added the :command:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.detection_probability` command to :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`, which
   allows one to define a Pd vs. SNR curve as an alternative to using the Swerling detector.

**(CR 8699)** Added the :ref:`signal_processor.mti_adjustment` to :ref:`Radar_Signal_Processors` types, which allows one
   to define a curve to reflect the increasing difficulty in attempting to detect targets with a GMTI sensor as they move
   with ever slower speeds.

**(CR 8710)** The message length and priority can be now be set individually for a sensor modes
   (:command:`sensor.message_length`, :command:`sensor.message_priority`).  Similar commands were defined for
   :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR <WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR>`, :ref:`WSF_VIDEO_PROCESSOR`, This eliminates the most of the need to create scripts for setting these parameters.

Documented the :method:`WsfTrackProcessor.is_track_reportable` script method in :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`. This
   method has existed since the earliest releases and is useful for implementing custom reporting methods.

As part of **CR 8725** documented in the Corrections section above, the :command:`sensor_mode.frame_time` of a sensor may
   now be dynamically updated using the script :method:`WsfObject.ProcessInput` command (e.g.:
   <tt>PLATFORM.Sensor("radar").ProcessInput("mode MY_MODE frame_time 10 sec end_mode");</tt>). This currently only works
   for non-imaging sensors.

Added the :command:`random_seed_time` command.

Added commands to allow some 'list-type' items to be reset back to their initial or empty state. This allows these
   items to be reset and redefined when reusing an existing definition. The new commands are
   :command:`_.External_Link_Commands.clear_external_links` for external message routing, :command:`Platform Part Commands <_.platform_part.internal_link>`
   for internal message routing; **clear_categories** in :command:`platform <platform.clear_categories>` and
   :command:`_.platform_part.clear_categories`; :command:`sensor.ignore_nothing` for sensor detection control;
   and :command:`sensor_mode.reports_nothing` for sensor reporting control.

   Updated the script :command:`observer` capability so multiple script observers can be enabled for the same event. Also
   added the :command:`observer.disable` command to disable a previously registered observer.

**(CR 8731)** Added the command
   :command:`link16_interface.include_dis_entity_id_in_j3x_tracks` to
   :command:`link16_interface` which allows a new J3.X extension word that holds DIS Entity Id data to be
   included in J3.X Surveillance track messages.  Messages can be sent through :model:`WSF_JTIDS_TERMINAL <WSF_JTIDS_TERMINAL>`
   comm devices, and are also available via DIS Signal pdu's when configured.  :ref:`WsfTadilJ` for
   the new extension word is available.

**(CR 8786)** Added in more :model:`gain control methods <WSF_REPEATER_EFFECT>` to the
   :model:`WSF_REPEATER_EFFECT`.

**(CR 8813)** Allow optional definition of the :command:`platform.on_damage_received` script that will be called when
   a platform receives damage as the result of a weapon hit.

Added new script methods to :class:`WsfPlatform`: :method:`WsfPlatform.OrientationNED`, :method:`WsfPlatform.OrientationWCS`,
   :method:`WsfPlatform.SetOrientationNED`, :method:`WsfPlatform.SetOrientationWCS`, :method:`WsfPlatform.ConvertECSToWCS`,
   :method:`WsfPlatform.ConvertWCSToECS`

**(CR 8818)** Updated :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` to include an at_end_of_path option which defines what happens to
   the platform when the end of the TSPI file is encountered.

**(CR 8828)** Updated WSF DIS interface to send non-standard DIS pdu's containing beam range and color data for
   each "active" beam of each mode of each sensor of each platform in a simulation.  VESPA will receive and interpret
   these pdu's to display the appropriate beam range and color as the sensor mode(s) changes.  If a beam_parameters.txt
   file has been referenced, the beam data from these pdu's will override it.  Beam range can be set using the
   :command:`_.antenna_commands.maximum_range` command.  Beam color can be set using the
   beam_color_rgba command.  This capability is functional for the
   :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`, :model:`WSF_OTH_RADAR_SENSOR <WSF_OTH_RADAR_SENSOR>`,
   :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR <WSF_SAR_SENSOR>`, and the :model:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR <WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR>`.

Database Updates
================

Corrected issues with weapon inheritance causing SAMs not to shoot in legacy databases.

**(CR 8807)** In one of the classified WSF 1.7.0 databases, tracks received by RADAR_BRIGADE, RADAR_REGIMENT and
   RADAR_BATTALION players from subordinate RADAR_COMPANY players were not being sent up the command chain.
