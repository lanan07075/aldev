WSF 1.5.3 - 13 March 2009
-------------------------

General
=======

* The scripting language will now issue a warning if an attempt is made to use a null reference. See the
  Enhancements_ section below.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6283)** When using the :command:`sensor_plot.horizontal_map` function of :command:`sensor_plot`, it is sometimes
  necessary to give the platform containing the sensor-under-test a route with a velocity in order to model doppler
  constraints (for instance, when testing a SAR sensor). This was incorrectly causing the platform to be moved during the
  map generation. This modification prevents the platform from being moved.

* **(CR 6284)** Provided an alternative method for computing :command:`_.receiver` noise power as 'k * T_0 * B * Fn'.
  Specifying :command:`_.receiver.noise_figure` alone will cause the new alternative method to be used. Specifying
  :command:`_.receiver.noise_figure` along with :command:`_.receiver.antenna_ohmic_loss` or
  :command:`_.receiver.receive_line_loss` will cause the
  former method to be used.

* **(CR 6303)** WSF was detecting targets that SUPPRESSOR was not. This was traced to an issue where the apparent
  target elevation angle (after the approximation for atmospheric refraction), was different from SUPPRESSOR by about 0.1
  - 0.2 degrees. This was resulting in slightly different values for antenna gains, but was impacting the multi-path
  calculations to a greater extent. The angles differences have been reduced by an order of magnitude, and
  signal-to-Noise values are now within 0.1 dB.

* **(CR 6361)** WsfAntennaPattern::GetPeakGain was returning 1.0 instead of the peak gain of the table when the
  pattern was defined by the :ref:`antenna_pattern.pattern_table` command.

* **(CR 6367)** Messages were allowed to be transmitted and received over communications links even if the
  transmitter or receiver was off.

* **(CR 6368)** The 'Intercept_Pk', 'Pk_Degrade' and 'Pk' fields were not included in the WEAPON_HIT and
  WEAPON_MISSED :command:`event_output` if the target was marked as 'indestructible'.

Enhancements
============

* Enhanced the :model:`WSF_SLB_EFFECT` to blank targets based on probability draws and incoming signal (i.e. jamming
  signal) duty-cycle comparisons. Can set the type of target blanking to use via the
  :model:`target_blanking_effect <WSF_SLB_EFFECT>`. Target blanking also occurs for CW noise signals
  correctly as long as the main target signal return does not exceed the jamming signal by the blanking threshold.


* **(CR 6346)** Added in the capability to degrade the :command:`electronic protect (EP) <electronic_protect>`
  :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT` effect via an :command:`Electronic Attack (EA) <electronic_attack>` :model:`WSF_SLC_DEGRADE_EFFECT`. This effect
  addition allowed the introduction of the :command:`Electronic Attack (EA) <electronic_attack>` :model:`WSF_POL_MOD_EFFECT` effect to
  be implemented also.

* **(CR 5485)** Completed the implementation of the 'strip' mode in :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR <WSF_SAR_SENSOR>`.
  This also adds numerous methods to :class:`WsfImage`.

* **(CR 6362)** An :command:`event_output` PLATFORM_OMITTED message will now be produced (if enabled) if a
  platform is excluded from the simulation by the :command:`platform_availability` block or by
  the user-defined 'on_platform_injection' script.

* Added the script methods :method:`WsfGeoPoint.Offset` and :method:`WsfGeoPoint.OffsetWCS` to :class:`WsfGeoPoint`. This
  allows a point to be computed that can be supplied as a cue to a sensor, weapon or jammer, or as a point for navigation.

* Added the script method :method:`WsfArticulatedPart.CueToPoint` to :class:`WsfArticulatedPart`. This is useful for cueing
  a sensor, weapon or jammer to a computed location.

* Added new Fedora Core 6 compatible ATIF shared object libraries.  Now SAGE/ATIF works with either fc2-compatible
  ("ln3") or a fc6 compatible ("ln4") libraries.

* Added class WsfBroker, and WsfObserver::ExchangeEvent.  Enables functionality for the exchange of commodities
  and/or services between platforms, whether internally or externally modeled over a DIS network.  Initial implementation
  was for aerial refueling, but can also have application to many logistics exchanges as well.

* **(CR 6371)** Added the capability to input frequency-dependent peak power outputs for :command:`_.transmitter`
  with the :command:`_.transmitter.power` input command. This frequency dependency of the transmitter power is in addition
  to any frequency-dependent :command:`_.transmitter.antenna_pattern_table` gain table input.

* Enhanced run-time error detection for script methods.  Calling methods on null objects, and passing null objects
  as method parameters are now detected.  If a script call error is detected, an error message is printed to the screen
  with details about the problem.  A new related command :command:`_.script_commands.script_abort_on_null_references` has been
  added.

* Added several script methods to :class:`WsfWeaponEngagement` to make it more useful. In particular, it can query:

   * The location of the weapon and target at the point of closest approach
   * The miss distance at the point of closest approach
   * Whether or not the engagement is resulting in a hit or miss.

* Added a :method:`WsfGeoPoint.ToString` method to :class:`WsfGeoPoint` to allow easier printing.

* A steerable/slewable :model:`jammer  transmitter <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` being controlled externally can now be steered via the
  DIS emission PDU. The beam azimuth and elevation center will be used to cue the jammer transmitter to these centers,
  but restricted by the :command`slewing <_.articulated_part>` and
  :ref:`steering <Antenna_commands>` limits set in the WSF
  definition for the :model:`jammer <WSF_RF_JAMMER>`.
