WSF 1.7.4 - 3 Sept 2012
-----------------------

Removal of Old Object Types
===========================

As mentioned in the :ref:`wsf_1.7.2` release notes, the old mover models and the transitional names have been removed
(It was indicated this was going to be done in the WSF 1.7.3 release, but it was not done).

The changes are as follows:

* Removed **WSF_OLD_AIR_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_AIR_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_GROUND_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_GROUND_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_ROAD_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_ROAD_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_SUBSURFACE_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_SUBSURFACE_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_SURFACE_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_SURFACE_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_6DOF_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_6DOF_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** (use :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`)
* Removed **WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** (use :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER`)

In addition, the following models were removed:

* **WSF_IR10T_SENSO** and **WSF_IR10T_FLIR_SENSOR** - These were very error-prone implementations of a table-driven spectral
  infrared model. By now it is believed that users have upgraded to :ref:`sosm_interface.WSF_SOSM_SENSOR`.
* WSF_ATA_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_PROCESSOR, WSF_ATG_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_PROCESSOR and WSF_SAM_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_PROCESSOR - these
  were written before the implementation of the script language and are too limited to be of any practical use.
* WSF_DUMP_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR - This was a very simple processor written before the scripting language existed. that
  simply echoed some information about any message it received. Those who desire debugging currently embed writeln
  statements within their script logic.

General
=======

* The Microsoft compiler version 2003 is no longer supported. (See below).

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 9650)** Corrected a problem in :command:`sensor_plot` where negative values of contrast radiant intensity were
  clamped to zero when written to the plot file.

* **(CR 9651)** Corrected a problem in checking for containment in relative :command:`zones <zone>` attached to a platform. A
  point not in the same hemisphere as the observer will now be considered to be outside the zone. Note that this applies
  only to relative zones. Absolute zones are not affected because they are not dependent on the location of an observer.

* **(CR 9674)** Removed an invalid length check from the DIS PDU class. Errors messages were unnecessarily being
  written when the length of the PDU was valid according to the DIS specification.

* **(CR 9694)** Corrected a problem which caused unrotated :method:`WsfDraw ellipses <WsfDraw.BeginEllipse>` to appear with
  major axis perpendicular to the supplied heading as opposed to parallel.

* Corrected a problem where :model:`WSF_IRST_SENSOR` was computing an incorrect value for transmittance if
  :model:`atmospheric_attenuation <WSF_IRST_SENSOR>` was specified. Effectively, the path was always
  considered to be horizontal starting at the lower altitude of the two objects. Since the attenuation decreases with
  altitude the problem was smaller at higher altitudes and larger at lower altitudes

* **(CR 9857)** Corrected a problem in the J11 interface where the Seeker Acquisition Status was not indicating
  "tracking" even when an on-board sensor had the target in track.

* Corrected a problem where canceling a task while looping over a task list could crash the simulation.

* **(CR 9893)** Corrected a problem with both :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER` and :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` were
  simultaneous transmissions occurring when they should not.

Enhancements
============

* Explicitly added the concept of a track being "purgeable".  Added methods *SetPurgeable* and *IsPurgeable* to the
  WsfTrack class.

* Added :model:`WSF_EXCHANGE_PROCESSOR` for the platform-to-platform exchange of commodities or services, and related
  observable events EXCHANGE_QUERY and EXCHANGE_EVENT.

* Added the :command:`terrain.dted_checksum` option to the :command:`terrain` input block to allow use of (non-corrupt) DTED files
  with invalid checksums.

* Added option for Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinate input to :command:`platforms <platform.mgrs_coordinate>`,
  :command:`route.mgrs_coordinate`, and :command:`zone.mgrs`.

* Added :model:`WSF_ROTORCRAFT_MOVER`.  This new mover derivative allows the platform to decouple the velocity vector
  from the platform attitude (at least a lower speeds).  Permits the aircraft to hover in one direction, but maintain
  desired heading in another.  The mover also can also come to rest, and translate vertically.  Script commands that set
  a desired heading value are saved into the mover, and used at lower speeds (see documentation).  At high speed the
  aircraft does assume the heading angle to match the course direction.

* **(CR 9744)** Added the ability to use a [[Values#TimeReference|time reference]] for the time values in the
  :command:`execute at_time <execute>` and :command:`execute at_interval_of <execute>` commands.

* **(CR 9756)** Updated :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` so the Johnson criteria will be evaluated in a way that is more
  desirable. Additional inputs have been provided to allow customization of the evaluation process.

* Added the :command:`masking_pattern` capability, which provides a mean to model structural blockage during :command:`comm`,
  :command:`sensor` and :command:`weapon` interactions.

* Added the :command:`truth <track_manager>` track correlator.

* Officially documented and released the :command:`nearest_neighbor <track_manager>` track correlator.

* Added the :command:`dis_interface.max_allowed_bad_entity_states` input to the
  :command:`dis_interface`.

* Added the waypoint commands: :command:`route.aux_data` and :command:`route.maximum_flight_path_angle`.

* Added script :ref:`Auxiliary Data Methods <WsfWaypoint.Auxiliary_Data_Methods>` to :class:`WsfWaypoint`.

* Added the :command:`_.route_mover.path_compute_timestep` command to waypoint movers.

Developer Items
===============

* All of the Wsf<X>Types classes have been removed and their functionality has been moved to their respective Wsf<X>
  class. This eliminates almost 10% of the core classes and will help to stem the proliferation of files as new classes
  are defined. Some user code may have to implement the following changes:

  * Change Wsf<X>Type::Add() to Wsf<X>::AddType();
       e.g.: WsfPlatformType::Add() becomes WsfPlatform::AddType().

  * Change Wsf<X>Type::Clone() to Wsf<X>::CloneType();
       e.g.: WsfPlatformType::Clone() becomes    WsfPlatform::CloneType().

  * Change Wsf<X>Type::Find() to Wsf<X>::FindType();
       e.g.: WsfPlatformType::Find() becomes WsfPlatform::FindType().

* The Windows Visual Studio 2010 projects and solutions have been updated to support the 'x64' platform (64-bit
  build).

* Support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 and versions of the GNU Compiler Collection prior to 3.3 are no longer
  supported.

* All of the source code was updated to remove references to indicated as deprecated headers by the C++ standard.

* Added WsfNetworkInterface (class), a utility that enables easy setup of GenIO-based TCP, TCP Server, or UDP
  network connections.
