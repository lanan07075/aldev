WSF 1.6.5 - 25 Feb 2010
-----------------------

Important Notes
===============

* In preparation for a change in an upcoming release, all uses of :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER`, :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` and
  :model:`WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER` and should be either:

   * **replaced** with the synonyms **WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**, **WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER** and
     **WSF_OLD_UNGUIDED_MOVER** respectively.
   
   * or **upgraded** to use **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**, **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_UNGUIDED_MOVER**.
     These models have been available for quite some time and are in widespread use.

  In a future release(either 1.6.7 or 1.7.0) the new guided movers and guidance computer will become the default
  definitions:

   * **WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** will refer to the new implementation currently
     available as **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**.
   
   * **WSF_GUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** will refer to the new implementation currently available as
     **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER**.
   
   * **WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER** and **WSF_NEW_UNGUIDED_MOVER** will refer to the new implementation currently available
     as **WSF_NEW_UNGUIDED_MOVER**.

  The old models will continue to be available as **WSF_OLD_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER**, **WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER** and
  **WSF_OLD_UNGUIDED_MOVER**.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 7202)** Corrected two problems related when creating SAR dwell_time plot in
  sensor_plot.

  * If 'sar_constraint_plotting' was enabled, reasonable dwell times were being returned for sample points in back of
    the array face.
  
  * If 'sar_constraint_plotting' was not enabled and the target was outside the electronic beam steering limits, the
    dwell time was incorrect. (It was being set to approximately the same value as would have been computed if right at the
    edge of the steering limits).

* **(CR 7303)** Corrected a problem where :ref:`sosm_interface.WSF_SOSM_SENSOR` did not have the correct
  position when the **AttemptToDetect** method was called directly from :command:`sensor_plot`. This only affected plots where
  the sensor was being moved over the sample grid and the target was being held static (which is not the normal mode of
  operation).

  .. note::

      This would only affect programs that called **AttemptToDetect** directly instead of via **Update**.

* **(CR 7304)** Corrected a problem where the WCS->NED transformation matrix for a sensor was not being updated after
  the host platform moved. This problem exhibited itself when performing a :command:`sensor_plot` horizontal_map using a
  :ref:`sosm_interface.WSF_SOSM_SENSOR`, and where the sensing platform was being moved over the sample grid
  instead of the target. The problem affected :ref:`sosm_interface.WSF_SOSM_SENSOR`, :model:`WSF_IRST_SENSOR` and
  some relative geometry output in :command:`event_output`

* **(CR 7319)** Fixed a problem where the source track number in the header of the J11.0 WIFT message was not
  correct when the comm device being used was not a JTIDS terminal.
  The track number was defaulting to the entity ID.

* **(CR 7358)** Fixed a problem with the platform 3-D intercept script method. The altitude being returned was the
  track altitude not the intercept altitude.

* **(CR 7371)** Corrected several issues in the WsfEM_SurfaceClutter model. Incorrect angles between the beam and
  the clutter patch were being computed, thus causing incorrect gains to be used in the computation of the Transmitted
  and Received Powers. Also exclude the contributions from clutter cells at extremely close range because these were
  dominating the result. The antenna patterns are not real accurate enough at high off-boresight angles and could result
  in gains that are just a little too large. The resulting clutter return for short ranges could therefore be way too
  large.

* **(CR 7372)** The SENSOR_DETECTION_ATTEMPT event was not getting called because it was missing in the SALRAM
  AttemptToDetect function.

* **(CR 7373)** Added default values for each of the native script types (bool (false), int (0), double (0.0), char
  ('0'), and string ("")).

* **(CR 7374)** Fixed a bug where the Map::Exists method would cause a crash if a complex type was supplied as an
  argument to a map that contained native types.

* Changed GotoLabel and Label script methods on the Waypoint script class to SetGotoLabel and SetLabel for
  consistency within the scripting language.

* **(CR 7436)** When a weapon is fired a :class:`WsfStatusMessage` is sent which is supposed to contain the name of the
  weapon that was fired and the track ID of the target as supplied in the firing request. Enhancements added to 1.6.4
  resulted in the message containing a different track ID. This CR makes changes to once again have the message contain
  the track ID supplied in the firing request.

* **(CR 7442)** Corrected an situation where the 'apparent position' of and object (i.e. the position of an object
  with respect to a viewer, accounting for atmospheric refraction) was sometimes incorrect if the ranges were very, very
  long (e.g.: a sensor interaction between geostationary satellite and near-Earth object).

* **(CR 7445)** Corrected an issue in :model:`WSF_RADIUS_EFFECT` where the incorrect value was being returned for hte
  effect due to a comparison error.

* **(CR 7469)** Corrected an issue in **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER** that prevented empty non-terminal stages (stages other
  than the last that don't consume fuel) from transitioning to the next stage.

Enhancements
============

* Added script methods NetworkName, IsDefaultGateway,
  NetworkConnections and IsConnectionEnabled to :class:`WsfComm`.

* **(CR 7317)** Added script methods :method:`WsfMessage.SetSizeInBits` and :method:`WsfMessage.SetSizeInBytes` to
  :class:`WsfMessage` to allow setting message size.

* Added new script methods to execute global scripts and scripts on platforms and processors.  See
  WsfPlatform.:method:`WsfPlatform.Execute`, WsfProcessor.:method:`WsfProcessor.Execute`, and
  WsfSimulation.:method:`WsfSimulation.Execute`

* **(CR 7341)** Added in :model:`signal_power_gain <WSF_POWER_EFFECT>` and
  :model:`receiver_noise_power_gain <WSF_POWER_EFFECT>` in :model:`WSF_POWER_EFFECT`, primarily to increase the
  receiver noise when using the :model:`WSF_SLC_EFFECT` effect.

* Added :model:`WSF_DIRECTION_FINDER_PROCESSOR`, a specialized processor that is used to fuse multiple bearing-only
  tracks into a track with valid location.  It provides the effect of implementing a triangulation algorithm.

* Added :command:`route.bank_angle_limit` to the route commands.  The route movers will now respond to bank angle limits
  either on the mover or the route.

* **(CR 7344)** Added the :command:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER.aimpoint_altitude_offset`,
  :command:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER.aimpoint_azimuth_offset`, :command:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER.aimpoint_range_offset` and
  :command:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER.commanded_azimuth_offset` commands to **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** to aid in
  generating approach geometries that meet sensor constraints.
 
* Numerous enhancements for ballistic missile engagements:
      
   * Made numerous internal improvements to :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` to improve its speed and
     accuracy.
   
   * Updated :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` to allow selection of intercepts in which the intercept angle
     is 'acceptable'. Updated :model:`BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR` to produce the additional data needed by the launch computer.
  
  .. note::

      launch computer data must be regenerated to make use of this feature.

   * Added many methods to :class:`WsfLaunchComputer` to facilitate battle management decision making processes.

* **(CR 7354)**  Added to set of conditions required for successful :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` communication
  :model:`relay <WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>`.  Two additional conditions have been applied to the receiver configured to relay. 
  First additional: the relay receiver must be on the same subnetwork as the transmitter attempting to relay the message.
  Second additional: the relay receiver must be configured to relay to at least one transmitter that is on the same
  subnetwork as that of one of the receivers on the destination platform.

* **(CR 7381)** Added support for dynamic casting in WSF script using the standard casting syntax (i.e.
  '(<type>)'). If a cast fails dynamically a NULL reference is returned.

* **(CR 7384)** Added the ability to define the platform :command:`platform.creation_time` and the route
  :command:`_.route_mover.start_time` using a draw from a statistical distribution in addition to a constant value.
  
  .. note::

      Vespa has not been upgraded to handle the new syntax and will not be able to read files that make use
      of the enhancement. It will still, however, be able to read files that use old form where just a <time-value> is
      specified.

* **(CR 7386)** Added a script 'set' container that mirrors the functionality of the STL set. It supports union,
  difference, and intersection.

* **(CR 7446)** Numerous changes have been made to :command:`false_target`, :command:`false_target_screener` and
  :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT` to aid in better input data encapsulation and to improve some runtime performance issues
  for this release. Please refer to these sections for changes and updates. More changes will be coming out in the next
  release further improving performance and capability.
