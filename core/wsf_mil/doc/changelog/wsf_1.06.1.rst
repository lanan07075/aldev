.. _wsf_1.6.1:

WSF 1.6.1 - 29 June 2009
------------------------

General
=======

* Updated the :ref:`MTT` as a result of system-level tests conducted
  since the release of version 1.6.0

* Route mover types are now updated to the new mover code (previously activated with **WSF_NEW_MOVER**).  The old
  mover implementations are accessible by setting the environment variable **WSF_OLD_MOVER** with a non-empty value.

* The build processes have been updated so 64-bit executables can optionally be generated on Linux systems.

Corrections
===========

* Corrected a couple of issues with the :command:`sensor_plot's vertical_map <vertical_map>` command that caused
  incorrect results to be generated if the sensor under test was airborne. The first dealt with the incorrect conversion
  of negative downrange values and the second was incorrectly converting the target position from ground-range/altitude
  to world coordinates.

  .. note::

      This is NOT the command used to generate the often-seen vertical coverage diagrams. That command is
      :ref:`vertical_coverage <sensor_plot_vertical_coverage>`.

* Corrected an issue where additional sensor gains for :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`'s
  (:model:`integration_gain <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`, :model:`operating_loss <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`,
  :model:`adjustment_factor <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`, and
  :command:`_.transmitter.pulse_compression_ratio`) were not being taken into account for coherent
  :command:`electronic_attack` jamming techniques such as :model:`WSF_FALSE_TARGET_EFFECT`. These gains are now
  multiplied into the coherent jammer power and provided in the :command:`event_output`.

* **(CR 6707)** Corrected an issue that was introduced in release version 1.5.4 where an antenna pattern's tables
  for some :command:`antenna_pattern` types was being copied multiple times in memory for each instance causing
  **excessive memory usage**. Updated to share the tables where applicable to improve memory usage and memory limitation
  issues.

* **(CR 6716)** Modified the :command:`ALARM <antenna_pattern>` antenna pattern file reader so it could process
  pattern files from Windows systems when running on Linux systems.

* Corrected problem where outgoing DIS entity state velocity and acceleration were set to zero whenever a platform's
  appearance was non-zero.

* Corrected an issue when using false-targets where the beam pointing was often incorrect when performing an
  interaction on individual blips when the radar's two-way interaction failed on the blip. Corrected to allow for
  updating of the beam positioning even upon failure so the interaction between the jammer and the radar is correct and
  (sidelobe) antenna gain is looked up properly.

Enhancements
============

* Added the :command:`terrain.validate_terrain` to the :command:`terrain` block. This will check all of the supplied DTED data
  for reasonable values.

* Modified :command:`sensor_plot` to honor the :command:`sensor.initial_mode` selection of a sensor if the 'mode_name'
  command was not specified in the sensor_plot function block. Prior to this the first mode would be selected even if
  :command:`sensor.initial_mode` was specified.

* **(CR 6711)** Added the :command:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR.detection_probability` block to :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR`, which allow the
  definition of the probability of detection as a function of the received signal strength.

* Added in :method:`ActiveSpots <WsfWeapon.ActiveSpots>` and :method:`MaximumSpots <WsfWeapon.MaximumSpots>` script methods in
  :class:`WsfWeapon` to allow for more script functionality, control and insight into :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER` objects at the script
  level.

* Updated the :model:`WSF_RPJ_EFFECT` to default to the :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`
  :model:`number_of_pulses_integrated <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` input if the :model:`WSF_RPJ_EFFECT`
  :model:`samples_per_detection <WSF_RPJ_EFFECT>` is omitted.
