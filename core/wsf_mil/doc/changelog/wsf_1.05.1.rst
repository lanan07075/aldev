.. _wsf_1.5.1:

WSF 1.5.1 - 19 January 2009
---------------------------

Enhancements
============

* Provided initial documentation for **WSF_NEW_GUIDED_MOVER**, **WSF_NEW_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER** and WSF_OTIS_MOVER
  that were implemented in 1.5.0.

* Updated the :command:`dis_interface.entity_appearance` command in the :command:`dis_interface` to allow articulated parts for
  external entities to cause a signature change on the shadow entity. This provides a mechanism for modeling signature
  changes due to weapon bay door opening and closing.

* Added ***ranging_time*** and ***ranging_time_track_quality*** commands to **WSF_IR10T_SENSOR**.

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6173)** Corrected a problem in the scripting language where memory would grow infinitely until a crash
  occurred if arguments were passed to a script.

* Corrected a problem where :method:`WsfPlatform.ReturnToRoute`() would not work after using WsfPlatform methods
  :method:`TurnToHeading(), GoToAltitude(), or GoToSpeed() <WsfPlatform.GoToAltitude>`

* Corrected a problem in **WSF_IR10T_SENSOR** including:
   * 0-180&deg; azimuth tables were incorrectly used.
   * detection_threshold set to 0 regardless of user input
   * format of the transmissivity tables was changed to the standard format by swapping altitude and range data
