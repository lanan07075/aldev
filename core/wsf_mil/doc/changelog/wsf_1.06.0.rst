.. _wsf_1.6.0:

WSF 1.6.0 - 29 May 2009
-----------------------

General
=======

* Added Suppressor 7's Multiple Target Tracker (:ref:`MTT`; otherwise known as the "Bogdon"
  tracker).  Users should specify "mtt" as the :command:`track_manager.tracker_type` (or, specify "mtt" as the
  correlation and fusion methods in the track_manager block) to enable use of MTT.

* A new implementation of the standard waypoint movers (:model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`,
  :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_MOVER`) are provided as an option in this release. The new implementation
  can be used in place of the existing implementation by defining the environment variable **WSF_NEW_MOVER** with a
  non-empty value prior to running your application.

  This is the final release in which the new movers will remain an option. Pending no problems, the new movers will
  become the default with the 1.6.1 release. **It would be much appreciated if users would attempt to use the new movers
  and report any deficiencies.**

Corrections
===========

* **(CR 6512)** Fixed an issue where the script compiler would throw an error if an object was cast to a container
  type (i.e. Array or Map).

* **(CR 6515)** Fixed an issue where the script compiler would throw an error if a script's return type was a
  container type (i.e. Array or Map).

* **(CR 6523)** Fixed an issue where complex types weren't being removed from container types (i.e. Array and Map)
  when Erase is called.

* **(CR 6528)** Fixed an issue where the script method :method:`WithinFieldOfView <WsfPlatform.WithinFieldOfView>` for a
  :model:`jammer <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` always returned 'false' due to an implementation issue in software.

* **(CR 6532)** Fixed an issue with the script compiler not allowing a static method call inside of an if expression
  (e.g. if (WsfPlatform.FindPlatform("my-plat").IsValid()))

* Fixed an issue with false-targets causing a segmentation fault due to the false-target screener not properly
  clearing false-target blips.

* **(CR 6540)** Corrected an issue where a sensor would not detect targets if terrain was in use and the sensor was
  located where the terrain was below mean sea level. The simple round-Earth horizon masking check used early in the
  sensor detection process indicates masking occurs if either object is below mean sea level. When using terrain it is
  possible to be above ground level but below mean sea level, thus causing horizon masking to be declared as occurring,
  when in fact it should not.

* **(CR 6541)** :ref:`docs/event/sensor_events:SENSOR_DETECTION_ATTEMPT` events were not being generated for
  :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR`. The sensors were modified to invoke the SensorDetectionAttempt simulation
  observer.

* **(CR 6550)** Fixed an error in the function for setting the platform appearance word. A call to the function was
  clearing any previous settings.

* **(CR 6578)** Fixed an issue where the :method:`task manager StartJamming <WsfTaskManager.StartJamming>` and
  :method:`weapon StartJamming <WsfWeapon.StartJamming>` script methods allow for the setting of invalid frequencies and
  bandwidths. Any frequency that is out of bounds will not cause an assignment to be made. This fix does still allow for
  the setting of any frequency for barrage type jammers. Use of the :method:`task manager CanJam <WsfTaskManager>` and
  :method:`weapon CanJam <WsfWeapon.CanJam>` scripts can be used before calling the **StartJamming** script methods.

* Changed the way in which the :command:`electronic_attack` and :command:`electronic_protect`
  effects are applied in the software. There were some minor issues when dealing with the inheritance of some of the
  effects and their proper application when applied. This change should not be noticeable from a users perspective.

* Corrected a problem in the propagation algorithm used by the :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`.  This problem only manifested
  itself when TLEs were being used, and the current epoch preceded the epoch of the TLE.

* **(CR 6642)** Corrected a problem in :model:`WSF_IRST_SENSOR` where the use of an :command:`antenna_pattern` to implement
  installation effects (windows, etc.) was being applied twice. Also modified the :ref:`Azimuth-elevation_Table_Definition` 
  from within :command:`antenna_pattern` to accept **absolute** as a valid
  *<value-units>*. This eliminates the need to convert the effects tables to dB.

Enhancements
============

* Added the input command :command:`track_manager.tracker_type` to :command:`track_manager`.

* Added the input command :command:`track.frequency` to :command:`track`.

* Added the script method :method:`IsPredefined <WsfTrack.IsPredefined>` to :class:`WsfTrack`.

* Added the script method :method:`ActiveBeams <WsfWeapon.ActiveBeams>` and :method:`MaximumBeams <WsfWeapon.MaximumBeams>` to
  :class:`WsfWeapon` for :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER` weapon types.

* Added the input command :model:`frequency_band <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` for :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` weapon
  types.

* Made a :model:`jammer_group <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` be added as a  :command:`_.platform_part.category`
  also to aid in script checking via the :method:`CategoryMemberOf <WsfPlatformPart.CategoryMemberOf>` method.

* Changed the default :model:`group_power_distribution <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` to be 'constant' instead
  of 'average' to aid in the use of jammer groups as categories and not having to specify the
  :model:`group_power_distribution <WSF_RF_JAMMER>` also.

* Modified the :command:`terrain` input processing so it will abort if terrain sources were specified but they do not exist.

* Added the :command:`dis_interface.simple_detonations_exclude` command to the :command:`dis_interface` to allow
  :command:`dis_interface.simple_detonations` processing to be excluded for specified weapon platform types or associated
  weapon_effects.

* Added :command:`sensor_map horizontal_map command <horizontal_map.sensor_platform_yaw>` that allow  the
  orientation of the sensing platform to be specified.

* **(CR 6351)** Added the capability for the inherent perception of jamming based on the
  :command:`comm.jamming_perception_threshold` by a :command:`comm` system. Access to this perception is
  provided via the :method:`JammingPerceived <WsfComm.JammingPerceived>` script method. This capability was implemented to mimic
  a comm operator's ability to perceive jamming and possibly take corrective action.

* **(CR 6351)** Added the capability for the inherent perception of jamming based on the
  :model:`jamming_perception_threshold <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` by a :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` predefined
  sensor type. Access to this perception is provided via the :method:`JammingPerceived <WsfSensor.JammingPerceived>` script
  method. This capability was implemented to mimic a radar operator's ability to perceive jamming and possibly take
  corrective action.

* **(CR 6351)** Added in the capability to have :model:`alternate_frequencies <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` on
  a :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`. These alternate frequencies can be switched to by the :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT`
  :command:`electronic_protect` technique in the presence of jamming and/or at simulation initialization by
  issuing the :command:`randomize_radar_frequencies`  command.

* **(CR 6351)** Added the capability to randomize a radar's (of type :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`) frequencies at simulation
  startup via the :command:`randomize_radar_frequencies` and the
  :model:`alternate_frequencies <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`.

* **(CR 6351)** Added the new :command:`electronic_protect` capability of :model:`WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT` which
  uses the new :model:`jamming_perception_threshold <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` to detect the presence of
  jamming and change to a different mode or to an alternate frequency as defined by
  :model:`alternate_frequency <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`. Currently only valid for sensor's of type
  :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.

* Added new uplink features to :class:`WsfTaskManager` including new :method:`WsfTaskManager.StartUplinking` methods. 
  Includes related inputs for :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR` including :model:`uplink_source,
  uplink_comm, uplink_delay, auto_weapon_uplink, and auto_weapon_uplink_platform <WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR>`.  New related methods
  :method:`WsfTask.ResourceIsUplink` and :method:`WsfTask.ResourceIsProcessor` for :class:`WsfTask`.

* Added specialized script task types :class:`WsfWeaponTask`, :class:`WsfJammerTask`, :class:`WsfUplinkTask`.  These can be used in
  conjunction with a new form of :method:`WsfTaskManager.AssignTask`.

* **(CR 6623)** Added :method:`methods <WsfPlatform.InfraredSigState>` to query the current signature state of a platform.
  Also added the :ref:`docs/event/platform_events:PLATFORM_APPEARANCE_CHANGED` event to :command:`event_output` and :command:`observer`. This event will be issued
  whenever the :method:`signature state <WsfPlatform.SetInfraredSigState>`, :method:`concealment
  factor <WsfPlatform.SetConcealmentFactor>` or :method:`appearance word <WsfPlatform.SetAppearance>` is changed.

* Added :ref:`write_str <script>`, which provides a way to write data to a string. It's interface is the same as
  :ref:`writeln <script>`, but returns the string that was written instead of writing to the console.
