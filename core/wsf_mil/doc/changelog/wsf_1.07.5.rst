WSF 1.7.5 - 28 Mar 2013
-----------------------

General
=======

* The target recognition capabilities of WSF_AIMS_IMAGE_PROCESSOR were merged into :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR`, and
  WSF_AIMS_IMAGE_PROCESSOR is now deprecated.  In order to enable the :ref:`target_recognition_commands`
  capabilities in :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR`, a new flag, :model:`target_recognition <WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR>` must
  be set.

Corrections
===========

* Corrected a bug found in WsfTerrain::GetHeightExtremaIn() function, which intermittently failed to find terrain height maxima within a zone.

* **(CR 6564)** Fixed errors with script parsing/compiling. The file/line/column was not being reported correctly when an error was found.

* **(CR 9040)** Corrected an issue with the :model:`WSF_THREAT_PROCESSOR`.  It was erroneously classifying every track
  that lacked location and velocity data as a threat. Added two more input parameters that allow for such tracks to be
  threats, but their default value will not.

* **(CR 9779)** Corrected errors when using casting in script.

* Corrected an issue with :model:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT` where it would not use the
  :model:`required_j_to_s <WSF_TRACK_EFFECT>` value to limit the effects requirements.

* Corrected an issue with :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` where the signal list for detected multi-beam systems would list all of
  the signals on the detected system instead of just those that met threshold once one of the beams were detected.

* Corrected an issue with :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_FT_EFFECT` where default data was being used after the first interaction
  instead of input data for the EA interaction.

* Corrected an issue with waypoint movers where flying to far away points would sometimes not work.

* Corrected an issue where the spatial domain of the **WSF_HARM_MOVER** was being reported incorrectly.

* Corrected an issue where the distance limit given to a :class:`WsfClusterManager` was being doubled and so it created
  clusters twice the desired size.

* Corrected an error that caused a crash when using the "job_board_comm" feature of the :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR`.

* Corrected an issue with comm routing that erroneously classified some routing as a relay and then failed to route
  messages.

* Corrected an issue when comm routing with :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` where routes with more than one hop would
  fail.

* Corrected an issue where engagements with a weapon impacting a location, with no specific target and incidental
  damage turned on, resulted in erroneous incidental kills.

* Corrected an issue relating to route movers computing accelerations using waypoint speeds.  This behavior will now
  be triggered any time a waypoint speed is specified and no acceleration is specified on the mover or route.
  Previously, the computed acceleration would occur for only the first waypoint.

* Corrected an issue with the  :command:`platform.use_zone` command. If the <shared-zone-type> does not exist the
  simulation will halt with an error.

* **(CR 10079)** Corrected an issue where frequencies in RCS tables with the "plt_file" format weren't being read
  correctly.

* Corrected a problem in the :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` when
  :model:`compute_measurement_errors <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` is enabled, where errors in az and el were
  being computed using standard deviation values from the transmitter, rather than the receiver.

* **(CR 10118)** Corrected an issue with the Doppler shift calculation in :model:`WSF_ACOUSTIC_SENSOR`; it now uses the
  appropriate equation for the calculation.

* **(CR 10137)** Corrected an error with the :command:`observer` PLATFORM_APPEARANCE_CHANGED event. The expected script
  method is now PlatformAppearanceChanged not PlatformAppearance.

* **(CR 10146)** Corrected an error in the :class:`RIPR Job Board <WsfRIPRProcessor>` allocation
  algorithm: if there were more jobs than bidders, only the first jobs posted to the job board were allocated and awarded
  to the bidders.

Enhancements
============

* Extensively improved WsfExchange functionality so that exchanges of named goods types may occur across a DIS
  connection (i.e., a Tanker supplying JP8_Fuel to a Receiver).  See :model:`WSF_EXCHANGE_PROCESSOR`.

* Added in the capability to check if a given :model:`WSF_EP_TECHNIQUE` is active (i.e., in use/turned on) for a sensor
  via script interface call :method:`IsTechniqueActive <WsfSensor>`.

* Added :model:`WSF_MOBILITY_AND_FIREPOWER_LETHALITY` weapon effect.  Allows an explicit weapon to impart a Mobility or
  Firepower Kill, in addition to Catastrophic Kill.

* Added Mover "Mode" switching, via either waypoint crossing or upon script command.  Effect is Mover implementation
  defined.  See :model:`WSF_ROTORCRAFT_MOVER` for more details.

* **(CR 5718)** Script now supports operators \+\=, \-\=, \*\=, \/\=.

* **(CR 6786)** :class:`script_struct` added, allowing user-defined structs in script.

* **(CR 9364)** Script strings may now contain comment characters, i.e., string abc = "This #2 isn't a \/\* \*\/ \/\/
   comment";

* **(CR 9894)** Add the ability to set a purge interval on :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER` and :model:`WSF_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER`.
  For any message waiting in the transmission queue for a time greater than the purge interval will be dropped. The
  MESSAGE_DISCARDED event will be generated.

* **(CR 9928)** When using :command:`dis_interface.simple_miss_reporting` in the :command:`dis_interface` block a detonation
  result of 1 was being set when either the target was killed or damaged. This enhancement restricts the reporting of the
  Detonation PDU's detonation result to 1 when the target is killed otherwise a detonation result of 6 is reported for
  all other conditions.

* **(CR 10022)** If a probability of detection (Pd) vs range table is defined in the :model:`WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR` the
  required Pd will now be random variable unless :command:`use_constant_required_pd` is set to true.

* Added the capability to the :command:`false_target_screener` to specify a
  :command:`false_target_screener.j_to_s_delta_threshold` for limiting the sector count to only the false
  targets within the threshold wrt to the target threshold return.

* Added the capability for the **WSF_COMM_ROUTER** to use the proper comm device for outbound routed messages if
  that comm is on the same network as the next receiver.

* It is now possible to execute scripts on other objects, and access script variables on other objects, using the
  '->' operator.

  ::

   WsfPlatform plat = WsfPlatform.FindPlatform("plat");
   double x = plat->x;        // Get variable 'x' on the platform
   plat->y = 1.0;             // Set variable 'y' on the platform
   plat->local_script(1,2,3); // Call script 'local_script()' on the platform

  See :ref:`Script_Right_Arrow_Operator`

* New script functions: :class:`__print_callstack(), assert(), has_attr(...), has_script(...) <__BUILTIN__>`

* Added the "priority_selector" and "weighted_random" intermediate connector node types to the :command:`behavior_tree`
  for prioritized node selection and weight random selection, respectively.  Also added the complimentary parameters
  "run_selection" and "make_selection".

* Added the "channel_job_type" feature to the :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR` for allowing designation of some job channels
  for certain types of jobs.

* Added the :class:`WsfRouteFinder` capability.  Generates a route around given avoidance regions and returns a
  :class:`WsfRoute` to you for use.

* Added indirect fire capability with the wsf_fires library.  This capability allows for relatively easy
  definition of new indirect fire types (both explicit and implicit), and time-on-target.  New types defined in
  wsf_fires include :model:`WSF_FIRES_MOVER` and associated launch computer, :model:`WSF_FIRES_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`.  Also included
  is the script object, :class:`WsfBallisticPath`, which allows for impact prediction, time-of-flight prediction, and
  trajectory visualization.  The input option, :command:`ballistic_types` is used to categorize all launched platform types that
  are used for indirect fire.  Test cases and unclassified definitions for rocket, artillery, and mortars are provided in
  the "fires_demo" directory.

* Added a global selection to utilize :command:`quantitative_track_quality`.
  This selection enforces computation of track quality based on the track's state covariance, allowing for
  track "coasting."  It will be desirable to use this feature for more sophisticated tracking studies; however, it may
  invalidate task manager logic that uses track quality to make decisions (do not use with the WSF IADS, for instance).
  This feature defaults to "disabled."

* **(CR 10058)** radio entity type fields now populated in DIS transmitter PDUs.

* Added a high-energy laser (HEL) model, :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON`, to the WSF core.  This includes a core :ref:`default fluence model <Default_Fluence_Model>`.


* Moved :command:`thermal_system` model to the WSF core.  This is optionally used with the HEL weapons (e.g., :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON`) to model the total available shot time.

* Added the simulation control command, :command:`start_time_now`, for the purpose of synchronizing real-time simulations to the system clock.

* Added :command:`wsf_weapon_server` interface.  If defined, the interface listens for ASCII interface RELEASE_STORE commands and fires weapons.

* Added the script function :method:`System.Time() <System.Time>`.

* Added a filter option for the :model:`WSF_DIRECTION_FINDER_PROCESSOR`, as in use a Kalman filter.

* Added options to retain track history in the :command:`track_manager` and :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`.  The option to retain
  track a track history is specified using :command:`track_manager.retain_raw_tracks`, and the length of
  history to keep is set with the
  :model:`track_history_retention_interval <WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR>` option.

* **(CR 10109)** Allows the user to specify that each event be written as a single line in the event output file. A new flag was added to the event_output block called
  :command:`event_output.print_single_line_per_event`.

* **(CR 10110)** Added the :ref:`SetDamageFactor <WsfPlatform.Appearance_Methods>` script method to the :class:`WsfPlatform` script object.

* **(CR 10119)** Added the WsfPlatform.SetCommander() script access method.

* Implemented a much more extensive set of clutter data in the :ref:`ALARM clutter model <clutter_model.alarm>` than either the original ALARM data or the later tables that it replaces.  These data include most of the table sets from the book <u>Low-Angle Radar Clutter</u>, by Billingsley.

Developer Items
===============

* **(CR 10020)** Moved the WsfScriptGeoPointClass out of the WsfGeoPoint.cpp file and into a separate file.
  Performed some cleanup to the WsfScriptGeoPointClass.

* Refactored WsfSpaceMover and WsfNORAD_SpaceMover to derive from the base class WsfSpaceMoverBase.  This moves the
  orbital propagator object into the base class, along with common code for Initialize and Update methods.

* Removed, moved WsfCovariance::InitializeProcessNoiseECS into WsfKalman filter for clarity.  It masked what the
  position values were being set to.

* Code for the script parsing and execution was reworked to support features in this release and in support of a
  future script debugger.

Data Items
==========

* Added fires_demo to illustrate the use of :model:`WSF_FIRES_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_FIRES_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`.

* Added acoustic_demo to illustrate how to set up acoustic sensors and acoustic signatures.

* Added exchange_proc_demo to illustrate the use of the WSF_EXCHANGE_PROCESSOR.
