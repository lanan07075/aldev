    The repeater effect is essentially an implementation of applying some automated gain control methodology to the
    physical jamming power using an effect variable called the *repeater factor*. This effect can be used to mimic
    inverse gain and gain control/leveling methods of many repeater jamming systems.

    This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_attack` technique block as one
    of the many available effects for a given technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be
    specified in the effect block for this effect type.

Commands
========

.. command:: repeater_effect_control_method  <repeater-control-method> 
   
    Specifies a repeater control method as described in the table below for setting the type of data that will be used in
    calculating the *repeater factor* that will be applied to the jamming power.  This adjustment modifies the
    normally-determined jamming power. If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is
    specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in
    the system_type_data_.

    <repeater-control-method>    
        A string input that defines , valid values are listed in the table below:
    
        none
            No repeater effects will be applied. This control method is the default so inheriting effects only
            apply if this command is set to any other method besides this one.
        actuals
            Uses actual receiver (i.e., sensor or comm) data to derive the minimum, peak and actual gain values in which to set the repeater factor.
        repeater
            Uses the data from the :command:`repeater's <WSF_RF_JAMMER.mode.repeater>` ESM system's detection update to get the minimum, peak and 
            actual gain values in which to set the repeater factor. If the data is not set the repeater factor is not calculated.
        repeater_actuals
            Tries to use the repeater data first if it is available.  If this data is not available then actuals are used. Both of 
            these are described above in this table.

    Default: none

.. command:: gain_control_method  <gain-control-method> 

    Specifies the control method that will be used to determine the minimum gain value for use in calculating the
    **repeater factor**.  This adjustment modifies the normally-determined jamming power. If this input is specified
    within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as
    the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_. If more than one type is to be
    used then this input can be entered multiple times.

    <gain-control-method>
        A string input that defines , valid values are listed in the table below:
   
        none
            No repeater minimum gain control method will be applied. This gain control method is the default so
            inheriting effects only apply if this command is set to any other method besides this one.
        minimum_detect
            The minimum value of the repeater factor will be set based on the minimum power for which the
            jamming will be detected by the receiver plus the minimum_detect_factor_ and within the maximum gain data of the
            impending transmitter. For coherent type jamming waveforms the minimum repeater factor will be calculated using the
            minimum detection threshold as the base, for noncoherent (i.e., noise types) this value will calculated using receiver
            noise power value for the base.
        jammer_to_noise
            The minimum value of the repeater factor will be set based on the minimum power for which
            the jamming meets the desired_jammer_to_noise_ value and within the maximum gain data of the impending
            transmitter. For coherent and noncoherent type jamming waveforms the minimum repeater factor will be calculated using
            the receiver noise power value for the base.
        jammer_to_signal
            The minimum value of the repeater factor will be set based on the minimum power for which
            the jamming meets the desired_jammer_to_signal_ value and within the maximum gain data of the impending
            transmitter. For coherent and noncoherent type jamming waveforms the minimum repeater factor will be calculated using
            the receiver received signal power value for the base.
        masking
            The minimum value of the repeater factor will be set based on the minimum power for which the
            jamming will be effectively mask the target return in the receiver plus the masking_factor_ value and within
            the maximum gain data of the impending transmitter. For coherent type jamming waveforms the minimum repeater factor
            will be calculated using the target return power for the interaction currently be calculated or using the desired
            return power for the RCS of the false target interaction, for noncoherent (i.e., noise types) this value will
            calculated using the power that is required to mask the target return of the impending interaction being calculated.
        desired_rcs
            The minimum value of the repeater factor will set based on the minimum power for which the
            jamming will be effectively meet the desired_false_target_rcs_ value by the receiver based on the maximum gain
            data of the impending transmitter.  This is for coherent type jamming waveforms only and the minimum repeater factor
            will be calculated using the target return power with the RCS ratio of the desired over the actual used in the
            interaction. This method only affects false target blips currently.

    .. note::
   
       The maximum repeater factor for multiple of the above will be used, within the limits of the gain data
       for the transmitter.

    Default: none

.. command:: desired_false_target_rcs <area-value>

    this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_.

    Default: 0.0 dB 

.. command:: desired_jammer_to_signal  <dbratio-value> 

    Specifies the desired J/S value, where J is the jamming power and S is the signal power in the receiver, that the
    repeater factor will calculated for. This input automatically sets the gain_control_method_ to
    **jammer_to_signal**. If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to
    a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the

    Default: 0.0 dB 

.. command:: masking_factor  <dbratio-value> 

    Specifies the factor that will be added to (in db, multiplied in absolute) to the calculated minimum detect repeater
    factor when the gain_control_method_ is set to **masking**. If this input is specified within the
    system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the
    'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_.

    Default: 0.0 dB 

.. command:: system_type_data  <system-type-name> ... end_system_type_data 

    Input block to provide the system type (e.g., SENSOR-TYPE, JAMMER-TYPE) specific data necessary to implement this
    technique for a given system type. Default data can be set up for system types not defined using the "default" string

    <system-type-name>
        A string input of the system-type the following data applies to, valid values are
        **[system-type-name | "default"]**. Default data is used for unspecified system-types and if not defined no effect will
        be applied for the given system-type.

    .. note::

        This input is most often used by :command:`electronic_attack` definitions to specify different sensor-type
        data. It may be used by an :command:`electronic_protect` definitions to specify jammer-type data inputs, but most often data
        is just entered outside this input block and is applied against all jammer-types for :command:`electronic_protect` effects.
