Overview
========

:model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` implements a mover that is capable of representing a guided glide bomb, or a single or multistage
guided missile or rocket with a moderate degree of fidelity. The model has the following characteristics:

* 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) equations of motion are used, treating the body as a point-mass. Angular rates and attitude
  are not modeled. The orientation of the platform is aligned with the velocity vector with no angle-of-attack or roll.
  Deviations from this orientation may be imposed by the angle_of_attack_, bank_to_turn_ and the guidance program
  :ref:`guidance_program_types.ATTITUDE_PROGRAM`, but they do not affect performance. If higher fidelity is required then
  :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` should be considered, but it has greater data and run-time requirements.
* Propulsion is not required to model a glide-bomb type weapon, but if propulsion is desired, each the thrust, fuel mass and
  rate of fuel consumption can be provided for each stage.
* Mass properties and propulsion input are both flexible, and any omitted values will be calculated if possible.  On
  multistage vehicles, lower stages will carry as payload the aggregate mass of each upper stage.  Interrelated values
  include thrust, burn_rate, thrust_duration, specific_impulse, fuel_mass, empty_mass, total_mass.  If all values are
  specified, but they do not sum consistently, an error message will be generated during initialization.
* Aerodynamic drag and lift are utilized to respond to guidance commands (See :command:`aero` class.) The platform will turn to
  intercept a target track within the specified aerodynamics constraints.  The model will not properly guide to intercept
  if aerodynamics are insufficient due to inadequate maximum lift coefficient or inadequate dynamic pressure (flight at extreme altitudes or low speeds).
* The trajectory to be flown will be determined by the :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` processor that must be present on
  the same platform.  The guidance computer will supply the desired lateral and vertical forces to steer the mover.

A :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` is typically part of a platform type that is launched by an instance of :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON`.
The platform type also typically includes a :model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` to provide guidance and a :model:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE` to
indicate when to terminate.

Derivation of Stage Input Values
================================

A lot of flexibility exists in what input values can be specified to generate the necessary internal values.
The internal values necessary for proper operation are:

* Initial mass for the structure and fuel.
* When the engine starts and stops and any coasting period before the engine starts or after the engine stops and prior to stage separation.
* At each time step it must be able to determine the current thrust and fuel consumption rate.

The mover will attempt to take whatever input values are provided and derive any necessary internal values. As an example, to derive
the necessary mass values:

* If total_mass_ and fuel_mass_ are supplied, empty_mass_ can be derived.
* If total_mass_, burn_rate_ and thrust_duration_ are provided:

  * fuel_mass_ can be computed as burn_rate_ \* thrust_duration_
  * empty_mass_ can then be computed as total_mass_ - fuel_mass_

* If total_mass, specific_impulse_, thrust and thrust_duration are provided:

  * burn_rate_ can be computed using the definition of specific impulse (see below).
  * fuel_mass_ can then be computed as burn_rate_ \* thrust_duration_
  * empty_mass_ can then be computed as total_mass_ - fuel_mass_

The definition of specific impulse is very useful because it relates thrust, burn rate and specific impulse:

   :math:`F_{thrust} = g_0 * I_{sp} * \dot{m},`

Where:

   * :math:`F_{thrust}` is the thrust of the engine(Newtons)
   * :math:`g_0` is the standard acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface (9.80665 m/s\ :superscript:`2`)
   * :math:`I_{sp}` is the specific impulse (seconds)
   * :math:`\dot{m}` is the mass flow rate (kg/s)

Given two of the three variable values the third can be determined.

Things become a little more complicated when 'referenced' thrust or specific impulse values are provided (i.e.: vacuum_thrust_,
sea_level_thrust_, vacuum_specific_impulse_, sea_level_specific_impulse_). If **ANY** referenced value is provided then **ALL**
must either be provided or derivable. The following derivation rules are applied in order.

* If three of the values are provided, the fourth can be trivially determined.
* If vacuum_thrust_ and sea_level_thrust_ are provided and burn_rate_ is provided or derivable AND nozzle_exit_area_ is NOT provided,
  vacuum_specific_impulse_ and sea_level_specific_impulse_ can be determined using the definition of specific impulse.
  nozzle_exit_area_ will also then be derived.
* If vacuum_specific_impulse_ and sea_level_specific_impulse_ are provided and burn_rate_ is provided or derivable AND nozzle_exit_area
  is NOT provided, vacuum_thrust_ and sea_level_thrust_ can be determined using the definition of specific impulse.
* If only one of vacuum_thrust_ or sea_level_thrust_ is provided AND nozzle_exit_area is provided, the other can be derived.
* If only one of vacuum_specific_impulse_ or sea_level_specific_impulse_ is provided AND nozzle_exit_area is provided AND
  the paired thrust value is provided or derivable, the other value can be determined.

Note that derivations are recursively applied until no further derivations can be performed. The use of show_status_ is encouraged
to ensure that the derived values are appropriate.

.. block:: WSF_GUIDED_MOVER

Global Commands
===============

.. command:: integration_timestep <time-value>

   Specifies the integration timestep to be used. If a value of zero is specified the mover will not break update requests
   into smaller intervals.

   This command can be specified inside and outside **stage** blocks. If it is outside the block then it becomes the
   default for any stage that does not specify a value.

   **Default:** 0.0 seconds

.. command:: integration_method [ rk2 | rk4 | trapezoidal ]

   Select the method for integrating the equations of motion as one of the following:

   * **rk2** - 2-stage Runge-Kutta
   * **rk4** - 4-stage Runge-Kutta
   * **trapezoidal** - trapezoidal

   .. warning:: Pre-2.9 versions of AFSIM have not fully implemented the Runge-Kutta methods for this mover. Instead of computing all forces for each integration substep, only the gravitational force was recomputed. This meant that the integration did not achieve an actual Runge-Kutta integration quality. When selecting a Runge-Kutta method, be sure to consider the option compute_all_forces_each_substep_.

   **Default:** rk2

.. command:: compute_all_forces_each_substep <boolean-value>

   Specify whether Runge-Kutta methods should compute all forces for each integration sub-step. If this is false, then only the gravitational force will be computed for each sub-step, and the aerodynamic and thrust forces will be computed once from the state at the start of the integration step. This option is ignored when the integration_method_ is trapezoidal. The default value for this option is false, which matches how the :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` had been implemented in pre-2.9 versions of AFSIM.

   .. note:: The default value for this is false to avoid perturbing existing simulation results. Any new scenarios developed should use true for this option. In the future, the path to eliminating the legacy, incorrect, Runge-Kutta implementation will be to change the default value to true. For this reason, in cases where the legacy behavior is desired, it is recommended to explicitly indicate that this flag is set to false.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: coordinate_frame [ wcs | eci ]

   Specify the coordinate frame in which the equations of motion are integrated as either:

   * **wcs** - :ref:`World Coordinate System <WCS>`
   * **eci** - :ref:`Earth Centered Inertial <ECI>`

   'eci' is currently intended only when modeling an orbital launch vehicle and should not be used for other purposes.
   Note that a launch computer created with ECI coordinates is specific to a launch location.

   **Default:** wcs

.. command:: maintain_inclination <boolean-value>

   When modeling an orbital launch vehicle (using coordinate_frame_ eci), the inclination of the parking orbit is a function of
   the launch latitude and launch azimuth (or heading). For a non-rotating spherical Earth, the inclination of the orbit is
   defined by:

      :math:`cos(inclination) = cos(launch\_latitude) * sin(launch\_heading),`

   But the Earth is rotating and that introduces an easterly ECI velocity component to the vehicle (in excess of 460 m/s when
   launched at the equator.) If anything other than a pure easterly or westerly launch heading is utilized then the additional
   easterly velocity will have some part that is lateral to the intended flight path and will result in the trajectory bending
   slightly towards the equator. In real life the mission planners will adjust the initial conditions and/or guidance to ensure
   the vehicle reaches the desired orbit altitude with the desired inclination.

   If the value of this command is true, the cross-track velocity component due to the Earth's rotation will be
   ignored and the trajectory will not bend towards the equator. This makes it easier to create scenarios that require
   a specific orbit inclination because one can simply use the above equation to determine the launch heading given the
   launch latitude and desired inclination.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: show_status

   Causes a message to be written to standard output whenever a staging operation takes place. This is automatically
   enabled if :command:`_.platform_part.debug` is also enabled.

.. command:: show_trajectory

   Enables a printout of downrange distance, speed, Mach number, and applied aerodynamic forces to standard output.
   
.. command:: align_heading_with_velocity <boolean-value>
   
   If true, use the velocity of the owning platform (if non-zero) to determine the projected heading. Otherwise, use orientation.
   
   **Default:** false

.. command:: check_for_ground_impact

   Enables internal checking for ground impact. This can be used where the mover is simply being used to model an orbital
   launch vehicle or the spent stage of a rocket. Formerly one had to define an instance of :model:`WSF_GROUND_TARGET_FUSE`
   on such platforms to detect if they crashed into the ground. If this was not done the platform would keep going
   and never be deleted.

.. command:: time_history_path <path-name>

   If specified, indicates the path.

Stage Definition
================

A mover based on :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` must contain one or more **stage** blocks.

::

 stage <stage-number>
    ... stage subcommands ...
 end_stage

where *<stage number>* must be a value that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the current number
of defined stages plus one.  If the value specifies a stage that already exists then the enclosed subcommands override
the values in that stage.  If the value is equal to the current number of defined stages plus one then a new stage is
created and populated with the enclosed subcommands.  It is invalid to specify a stage number that is more than one
higher than the current highest defined stage number.

Following are the the subcommands that may occur in a **stage** block:

.. command:: aero <aero-type-name>
             aero none

   Specifies the :command:`aerodynamics type <aero>` name for this stage.  Type must be known at initialization time.

   An <aero-type-name> of **none** implies that no aerodynamic forces will be calculated. This is appropriate for stages
   that operate outside of the atmosphere.

   **Default:** Must be provided.

.. command:: empty_mass <mass-value>

   Specifies the mass of the stage without fuel.

   **Default:** 0.0 kg

.. command:: fuel_mass <mass-value>

   Specifies the mass of the fuel on the stage.

   **Default:** 0.0 kg

.. command:: total_mass <mass-value>

   Specifies the total mass of the stage, which is the sum of empty_mass_ and fuel_mass_ but does not
   include the mass of any upper stages on top of this one (considered payload).

   **Default:** 0.0 kg

   .. note::

      For backward compatibility, this same value may be supplied via the keywords:  'launch_mass', 'mass',
      'initial_mass', or 'weight', but future support of these keywords is not guaranteed.

.. command:: thrust <force-value>
.. command:: sea_level_thrust <force-value>
.. command:: vacuum_thrust <force-value>

   Specifies the thrust of the propulsion system.

   If this value is not provided an attempt will be made to derive it from other provided or derived input values.

   .. note::

      If a sea level or vacuum value is specified then nozzle_exit_area_ may also need to be supplied.
      See `Derivation of Stage Input Values`_ above.

.. command:: thrust_table ... end_thrust_table
.. command:: sea_level_thrust_table ... end_sea_level_thrust_table
.. command:: vacuum_thrust_table ... end_vacuum_thrust_table

   Defines thrust as a function of time.

   .. parsed-literal::

      thrust_table
         <time-1> <thrust-1>
         ...
         <time-n> <thrust-n>
      end_thrust_table

   .. note::

      Time values must be monotonically increasing and there must be at least two time/thrust entries.

   .. note::

      If a sea level or vacuum thrust table is specified alone then nozzle_exit_area_ must be supplied.
      See `Derivation of Stage Input Values`_ above.

.. command:: reverse_thrust

   Indicates the thrust is to be applied in the reverse direction (i.e., it is acting as a braking force instead of a
   propelling force).

.. command:: specific_impulse <time-value>
.. command:: sea_level_specific_impulse <time-value>
.. command:: vacuum_specific_impulse <time-value>

   Specify the specific impulse of the propulsion system with respect to a particular condition.

   If this value is not provided an attempt will be made to derive it from other provided or derived input values.

   .. note::

      If a sea level or vacuum value is specified then nozzle_exit_area_ may also need to be supplied.
      See `Derivation of Stage Input Values`_ above.

   .. note::

      If specific impulse is given in N-sec/kg, one must divide by 9.80665 m/sec\ :sup:`2` to get units of seconds.

.. command:: nozzle_exit_area <area-value>

   Specifies the exit area of the engine nozzle.  This is used to adjust a sea level or vacuum reference thrust or
   specific impulse values from the reference value to the value at the current operating altitude.

   **Default:** none - this always required when vacuum_thrust_table_ or sea_level_thrust_ table is used.
   If may be required when using sea level or vacuum referenced values for thrust or specific impulse.
   See `Derivation of Stage Input Values`_ above.

.. command:: thrust_duration <time-value>

   Specifies the amount of time the engine will produce the specified thrust.

   If this value is not provided an attempt will be made to derive it from other provided or derived input values.

   * The last time value in the burn_rate_table_ if provided.
   * The last time value in the thrust_table_, sea_level_thrust_table_ or vacuum_thrust_table_ if provided.
   * Computed from other available values.

   .. note::

      Depending on what input values are provided, the actual thrusting time may be different than this
      value. The engines will continue to burn as long as fuel is available or until terminated by the guidance computer.

.. command:: burn_rate <mass-flow-value>

   Specifies the propellant burn rate while thrusting.

   If this value is not provided an attempt will be made to derive it from other provided or derived input values.

.. command:: burn_rate_table ...end_burn_rate_table

   Defines propellant burn rate as a function of time.

   .. parsed-literal::

      burn_rate_table
         <time-1> <burn-rate-1>
         ...
         <time-n> <burn-rate-n>
      end_burn_rate_table

   .. note::

      Time values must be monotonically increasing and there must be at least two time/burn_rate entries.

.. command:: throttle <table-value>

   This provides a function to adjust the current thrust and burn rate (The adjustment is just a multiplication). The dependent value
   is the non-dimensional throttle factor is greater than or equal to zero. A value of zero corresponds to no thrust and one corresponds
   to full thrust. Values greater than one are allowed when the base thrust and burn rate values are less than the maximum.

   The allowed independent variables (and their units) are:

   * time (:argtype:`\<time-units\> <time-units>`): The time since the engine ignited.
   * altitude (:argtype:`\<length-units\> <length-units>`): The altitude of the platform.
   * speed (:argtype:`\<speed-units\> <speed-units>`: The speed of the platform
   * mach (non-dimensional): the speed of the platform specified as a Mach number.

.. command:: thrust_vectoring_angle_limit <angle-value>

   Specifies the maximum angle to which the thrust vector can be steered.

   **Default:** 0 deg (thrust vectoring is not allowed).

.. command:: thrust_vectoring_time_limits <time-value> <time-value>

   Specifies the minimum and maximum times (relative to the ignition time of the current stage) in which thrust vectoring
   can be employed.

   **Default:** No limits. Thrust vectoring may be employed anytime while the engine is producing thrust.

.. command:: lateral_thrust_gain <real-value>

   Lateral forces may be applied by vectoring the thrust of the engine or through the use of thrusters. These forces typically
   typically have a large moment arm (the engine is at the end of a rocket and is some distance from the center of gravity)
   and as such, introduces a rotation which then causes a change in the direction of the velocity vector. This issue is that
   this model treats the body as a point-mass (See Overview_) and does not consider angular rates - it operates by 'pushing'
   the mass to change direction. It takes more force to 'push' the mass to change direction by a given angle than it takes to
   rotate the same amount. Because more force is needed, a higher vectoring angle is needed, thus stealing more thrust from the
   axial component.

   This is a fudge factor that attempts to compensate for the difference. It typically isn't important except when creating
   orbital launch vehicles that are operating at the edge of performance to lift large masses into orbit. If required,
   values of 5 or 10 aren't unreasonable. Don't be afraid to go even higher.

   **Default:** 1

.. command:: divert_thrust <force-value>

   Specifies the amount of thrust to be considered available from thrusters. The 'divert' capability is a
   trivial implementation of real thrusters. It was initially provided so vehicles could still maneuver at
   high altitudes where available aerodynamic forces are small or non-existent.

   At any given time, the guidance computer (:model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER`) determines the accelerations
   required to achieve the current objectives (intercept, turn to a heading, climb to an altitude, etc.)
   :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` will attempt to satisfy the requested accelerations as follows:

   * Utilize thrust vectoring to satisfy as much of the request as possible. Thrust vectoring is available
     if thrust_vectoring_angle_limit_ is defined.
   * Utilize available aerodynamic forces to satisfy as much of whatever remains of the request as possible.
   * Utilize divert thrust to satisfy as much of whatever remains of the request as possible.
     Divert thrust is available when all of the following are true:

     * divert_thrust_ is greater than zero.
     * The current divert fuel mass (initially the value of divert_fuel_mass_) is greater than zero.
     * The current altitude is within the limits specified by divert_altitude_limits_.

   * Any part of the request that remains after the preceding steps will be unsatisfied.

   As mentioned above, this is a trivial implementation. Real thrusters typically operate at full thrust
   for very brief periods. Because of the simple nature of :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` (3-DOF, point mass,
   simplified aerodynamics) a true thruster model is not reasonable. Less than full thrust and fuel flow
   rate are utilized if the requested accelerations do not require it. A real model would typically actuate
   the thruster for a shorter period of time.

   **Default:** 0 Nt (divert is not available)

   .. note::

      If divert_thrust_ is greater than zero then divert_fuel_mass_ and divert_fuel_flow_rate_ must both
      be greater than zero.

   .. note::

      divert_thrust_ should not be specified in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` that is part of a weapon scenario that is being used by weapon_tools to generate :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` data, but can be used in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` for the same weapon scenario being executed by mission or Warlock.

.. command:: divert_fuel_mass <mass-value>

   Specifies the initial mass of fuel available for divert thrust. When divert_thrust_ is used it
   will expend the divert fuel until it is no longer available.

   .. note::

      divert_fuel_mass_ is **not** considered as part of the mass of the vehicle (i.e.: its mass does not
      affect the equations of motion). divert_fuel_mass_ and divert_fuel_flow_rate_ serve only to limit
      how long divert can be employed. The assumption being made here is that the thruster and its mass are
      small compared to the rest of the vehicle.

   **Default:** 0 kg (A value greater than zero must be specified if divert_thrust_ is greater than zero)

   .. note::

      divert_fuel_mass_ should not be specified in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` that is part of a weapon scenario that is being used by weapon_tools to generate :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` data, but can be used in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` for the same weapon scenario being executed by mission or Warlock.

.. command:: divert_fuel_flow_rate <mass-flow-value>

   Specifies the rate at which the divert fuel will be used when full divert thrust is employed. If only
   some of the divert thrust is required to satisfy the current request then the fuel flow rate will be
   decreased proportionally.

   .. note::

      Specifying a small value will make divert available for a longer period.

   **Default:** 0 kg/s (A value greater than zero must be specified if divert_thrust_ is greater than zero)

   .. note::

      divert_fuel_flow_rate_ should not be specified in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` that is part of a weapon scenario that is being used by weapon_tools to generate :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` data, but can be used in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` for the same weapon scenario being executed by mission or Warlock.

.. command:: divert_altitude_limits <length-value> <length-value>

   Specifies the minimum and maximum altitudes in which divert thrust will be considered for use.

   **Default:** No limits (available at all altitudes)

   .. note::

      divert_altitude_limits_ should not be specified in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` that is part of a weapon scenario that is being used by weapon_tools to generate :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` data, but can be used in a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` for the same weapon scenario being executed by mission or Warlock.

.. command:: pre_ignition_coast_time <time-value>

   Specifies the amount of time that will elapse between the start of the stage and when the engine will ignite.

   **Default:** 0.0 sec

   .. note::

      If this value is specified for the first stage, it represents a time when the platform is still 'on
      the pad' or 'on the rail'. The weapon platform will remain attached to the host launching platform until this time
      expires.

.. command:: pre_separation_coast_time <time-value>

   Specifies the amount of time that will elapse between the burnout of this stage and its separation from the vehicle.
   This command has no effect for single-stage vehicles or the last stage of a multistage vehicle.

   While this command combined with the pre_ignition_coast_time_ can be used to effect delays between stages or
   motor pulses, it is sometimes necessary to create dummy stages during which the vehicle just coasts. This is typically
   necessary when the weapon is released from the launching platform and then coasts for awhile before igniting the motor,
   but it my also be used for coasting and then jettisoning some mass. For instance::

      stage *<n>*
         pre_separation_coast_time   10 sec
         aero                        <aero-type>
      end_stage

   **Default:** 0.0 sec

.. command:: integration_timestep <time-value>

   Specifies the integration timestep for this stage.

   **Default:** The value of the global integration_timestep_ that occurs outside the stage definition.

.. command:: ignition_failure_probability <real-value>

   A value in the range [ 0 .. 1 ] that specifies the probability that the engines on this stage will fail to ignite.
   If ignition fails the results are as follows:

   * Mark the mover as 'broken'. This will trigger a :ref:`docs/event/mover_events:MOVER_BROKEN` simulation event.
   * The position will continue to be updated, but subject only to gravity and aerodynamic forces
     (i.e.: no propulsive forces.)

   **Default:** 0.0

.. command:: separation_failure_probability <real-value>

   A value in the range [ 0 .. 1 ] that specifies the probability that this stage will be unable to separate from the succeeding stage.
   If separation fails the results are as follows:

   * Mark the mover as 'broken'. This will trigger a :ref:`docs/event/mover_events:MOVER_BROKEN` simulation event.
   * The position will continue to be updated, but subject only to gravity and aerodynamic forces
     (i.e.: no propulsive forces.)

   **Default:** 0.0

.. command:: angle_of_attack <table-value>

   By default the model simply aligns the platform with the velocity vector with no angle-of-attack (See Overview_). This
   provides a mechanism to apply an angle of attack.

   This table provides a function to specify the angle of attack. The dependent value is the angle-of-attack with units
   :argtype:`\<angle-units\> <angle-units>`. The allowed independent variables (and their units) are:

   * time (:argtype:`\<time-units\> <time-units>`): The time since the engine ignited.
   * altitude (:argtype:`\<length-units\> <length-units>`): The altitude of the platform.
   * speed (:argtype:`\<speed-units\> <speed-units>`: The speed of the platform
   * mach (non-dimensional): the speed of the platform specified as a Mach number.

   **Default:** no angle_of_attack

   .. note::
      This does not affect the performance of the vehicle. It simply updates the attitude so sensors on other platforms
      get a more accurate aspect for signature lookups, and to make the visual presentation more realistic.

   .. note::
      This value takes precedence over any non-zero pitch angle caused by the guidance program
      :ref:`guidance_program_types.ATTITUDE_PROGRAM`. (If the commanded angle is zero then this value will be used.)

.. command:: bank_to_turn

.. command:: skid_to_turn

   By default the model simply aligns the vehicle with the velocity vector with no roll (See Overview_) 'bank_to_turn' indicates that
   a bank angle should be imposed. This angle is proportional to the amount of sideways aerodynamic forces being applied.

   **Default:** skid_to_turn

Script Interface
================

The mover will invoke the following script methods defined on the platform (not the mover) during certain key events in
the the life of a stage. These scripts can be used to display informational data, change signatures, etc.

.. command:: on_stage_ignition

   ::

      script void on_stage_ignition(int aStage) ... end_script

   Process the ignition of stage 'aStage'.

.. command:: on_stage_burnout

   ::

      script void on_stage_burnout(int aStage) ... end_script

   Process the burnout of stage 'aStage'.

.. command:: on_stage_separation

   ::

      script void on_stage_separation(int aStage) ... end_script

   Process the separation of stage 'aStage'.
