Overview
========

WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_ implements a launch computer for an air-to-air missile. This launch computer accepts
a target track, and evaluates which tabulated engagement condition most closely matches the track parameters.
It supplies the (Ranges and Times-of-flight) expected, to use for launch logic.

Air-to-air missiles are designed with a preferred range of employment:  short, medium, or long.  Regardless, all
missiles will have a minimum range below which they cannot properly arm and guide to intercept, a maximum range beyond
which they cannot successfully intercept, and a "no-escape" range of maximum lethality.  The minimum and maximum ranges
usually assume a level non-maneuvering target.  The "no-escape" range is between the min and max, and assume some
representative target ability (a G-loading) to turn and run away from the missile the instant it is launched.  Within
the no-escape range, there is a low probability that the target can be expected to escape.

Method of Operation
===================

The engagement results are functions of 6 independent variables (IVs):  **shooter altitude and Mach**,
**target altitude and Mach**, **target aspect angle** (nose on = 0 deg), and **target lead angle**.
and 6 dependent variables (DVs): **maximum range and time-of-flight**, **no-escape range and time-of-flight**,
and **minimum range and time-of-flight**.

The data tables can be quite large.  So that many launch computer instances may share common data tables, the input processing
is dedicated primarily to reading in a table of engagement results, which all computers of this type will collectively
reference.  The table is consulted to time the launch of a :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` against a target :class:`WsfTrack`.
The track must have valid WCS location and velocity.

Results are found by first taking each IV and finding the nearest in entry in the data table. Then once indices for each IV is determine, this set of
indices is used to lookup the result. In other words, the results are not interpolated values.

**Target aspect** is defined as follows:  Target aspect angle is measured in the horizontal plane from the velocity vector
of the target to the shooter line-of-sight vector, with a value from zero to 180 degrees.  This means nose on = 0 degrees target aspect!

**Target lead** angle is also measured in the horizontal plane, from shooter velocity vector to the target line-of-sight (similar to azimuth), but
positive if the target is converging laterally toward the shooter velocity vector, and negative if diverging away.

The :command:`weapon_tools<weapon_tools>` application assists with creation of launch computers of this type.
(See :command:`AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR`).

Commands
========

.. command:: load_table <file-name>

   Specifies a separate file to include.  This included file must contain the launch_computer_table_
   block.

.. command:: launch_computer_table ... end_launch_computer_table
   :block:

   Specifies the data table for expected results for weapon engagements.  This block may be included in-line in the launch
   computer block, and need not be in a separate file as in load_table_ above.  All of the subcommand inputs listed
   below are to be embedded within this block.

   .. command:: no_escape_manuever <acceleration-value>

      The acceleration used to define the target "turn tail to missile" evade tactic capability. Begins at missile launch.

   .. command:: independent_variables ... end_independent_variables
      :block:

      This block contains the data that defines the valid ranges of each of the independent variables for the engagement.
      Each IV must be given in increasing values.  If there are N shooter altitudes, M shooter Machs, P target altitudes, Q
      target Machs, R target aspect angles, and S target lead angles, then the intercept_results_ block must have
      NxMxPxQxRxS x 6 data values in it.

      .. command:: shooter_altitudes <distances> end_shooter_altitudes

         Specifies the shooter altitudes. May be uneven but must be in increasing numerical order. (Minimum delta = 100.0 m)

         .. parsed-literal::
          shooter_altitudes 10000 ft 20000 ft 30000 ft end_shooter_altitudes

      .. command:: shooter_machs <values> end_shooter_machs

         Specifies the shooter Mach numbers. May be uneven but must be in increasing numerical order. (Minimum delta = 0.05)

         .. parsed-literal::
          shooter_machs 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 end_shooter_machs

      .. command:: target_altitudes <distances> end_target_altitudes

         Specifies the target altitudes. May be uneven but must be in increasing numerical order. (Minimum delta = 100.0 m)

         .. parsed-literal::
          target_altitudes 10000 ft 20000 ft 30000 ft end_target_altitudes

      .. command:: target_machs <values> end_target_machs

         Specifies the target Mach numbers. May be uneven but must be in increasing numerical order. (Minimum delta = 0.05)

         .. parsed-literal::
          target_machs 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 end_target_machs

      .. command:: target_aspect_angles <angles> end_target_aspect_angles

         Specifies the target aspect angles (nose on = 0 deg). May be uneven but must be in increasing numerical order. (Minimum delta = 2.0 deg)

         .. parsed-literal::
          target_aspects 0 deg 30 deg 60 deg 90 deg 135 deg 180 deg deg end_target_aspects

      .. command:: target_lead_angles <angles> end_target_lead_angles

         Specifies the target lead angles. May be uneven but must be in increasing numerical order. (Minimum delta = 2.0 deg)

         .. parsed-literal::
          target_lead_angles 0 deg 30 deg 60 deg 90 deg 135 deg 180 deg end_target_lead_angles

      .. command:: target_lead_angle_limits from <angle-value> to <angle-value> by <angle-value>

         Specifies the target lead angles using a shorten notation. This is an alternate to the previous target_lead_angles command. (Minimum delta = 2.0 deg)

         .. parsed-literal::
          target_lead_angle_limits from -180 deg to 180 deg by 10 deg

   .. block:: WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER.launch_computer_table

   .. command:: intercept_results ... end_intercept_results
      :block:

      This block contains all the data points that define the intercept envelope.  There must be as many entries/lines as there are engagement
      conditions (see independent_variables_).  Any value of -1.0 indicates not-achievable.  It is recommended that
      this data be generated using the LAR generator tool called :command:`weapon_tools<weapon_tools>`.

      The format of the data is:

      .. parsed-literal::
       intercept_results
          Rmin :argtype:`\<length-value> <length-value>` :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>` Rne :argtype:`\<length-value> <length-value>` :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>` Rmax :argtype:`\<length-value> <length-value>` :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>`
          Rmin :argtype:`\<length-value> <length-value>` :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>` Rne :argtype:`\<length-value> <length-value>` :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>` Rmax :argtype:`\<length-value> <length-value>` :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>`

       end_intercept_results

      .. command:: Rmin <length-value> <time-value>

         Minimum range and time-of-flight for this condition, below which intercept is unsuccessful.

      .. command:: Rne <length-value> <time-value>

         No-escape range and time-of-flight for this condition.

      .. command:: Rmax <length-value> <time-value>
