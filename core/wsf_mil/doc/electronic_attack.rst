Overview
========

electronic_attack defines an electronic attack (countermeasure) capability for a transmitter.  An 
:command:`Electronic Attack (EA) <electronic_attack>` - :command:`electronic protect (EP) <electronic_protect>` architecture provides the ability to
define EA and EP techniques and assess the interaction of these techniques.  Multiple techniques are allowed for both
EA and EP capability blocks.  The effect at the receiver is as defined in the EA technique block unless the EP
technique block defines a mitigating technique with an associated effect for the particular EA technique being
considered.
