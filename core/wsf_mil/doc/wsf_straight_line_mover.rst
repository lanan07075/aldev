Overview
========

:model:`WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER` implements a mover for a :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` that flies in a (more or less) straight
line from the launch point to intercept a target track.  The user is relieved of the need to specify weapon mass
properties, propulsion, or aerodynamics tables, but with a resulting loss of fidelity.  The target track must be
provided by some WsfSensor or WsfProcessor type that populates the Current Target on the WsfPlatform, as obtained from
its WsfTrackManager.  This mover will implement either a constant average speed, or a speed table which is linearly
interpolated versus time of flight for the weapon.    Optionally, the user may specify a maximum lateral g limit which
will limit the magnitude of any initial or final maneuvering acceleration.

.. note::

    No provision is made for flight termination in the event of either a target hit or miss, or for lethality
    determination.  The firing :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` will normally supply the :command:`platform.weapon_effects` to be used,
    and a processor of type :model:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE` (or derived from it) will generally terminate the flight and invoke the
    weapon effect.

Mover Commands
==============

.. command:: update_interval <time-value>

   If non-zero, specifies a periodic time interval at which the simulation will call the mover.  If zero then the mover
   will be called only when it is necessary to determine the position of the containing platform.

   Default: 0 seconds unless overridden by the specific mover implementation.

.. command:: update_time_tolerance <time-value>

   When a position update is requested by the simulation, if the time since the previous update is less than or equal to
   this value then the mover will ignore the update.

   Default: Most mover implementations define this as the time it takes to travel 1 meter at some nominal velocity that is
   appropriate for the implementation.

   .. note::

         A mover implementation may choose to ignore this command.

Straight Line Mover Commands
============================

.. command:: average_speed <speed value>

   Specifies the weapon's average speed that will be used for the duration of flight.

.. command:: tof_and_speed  ... end_tof_and_speed

   Specifies the weapon's speed versus time profile that will be used.  The time values must be in increasing numerical
   order. ::

      tof_and_speed
         0.0 sec   1500 kts
         10.0 sec  1200 kts
         20.0 sec  1000 kts
      end_tof_and_speed

.. command:: maximum_lateral_acceleration <acceleration value>

    Specifies the weapon's maximum lateral acceleration that will be used for weapon maneuvers.

.. command:: guidance_mode  [ lead_pursuit | pure_pursuit ]

    Specifies the weapon's guidance mode.  Using **lead_pursuit**, the velocity vector will always be aimed toward the
    current target track if stationary, and if the track is moving, will be extrapolated as necessary for a predicted time
    to intercept, mimicking proportional navigation guidance.  Using **pure_pursuit**, the velocity vector will always be
    aimed toward the current target track.

    Default: pure_pursuit

.. command:: guide_to_truth <boolean-value>

    Specifies if the perceived target location (as defined by the current target track) or the truth target location should
    be used in the guidance computations.

    Default: false
