Overview
========

:model:`WSF_OTH_RADAR_SENSOR` provides a baseline Over-The-Horizon Backscatter (OTH-B) Skywave radar implementation. It is
capable of using the ionosphere to reflect energy over the visual horizon in an attempt to detect targets. Note to
analysts:  This implementation is a single-bounce only sensor that is based on the Chapman Ionosphere model. This
implementation focuses on a bounce in the F Region of the ionosphere, specifically the F2 Layer. This area has the
highest electron density.

The OTH-B radar definition is very similar to that found in the baseline :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`. The OTH Mode Commands
are identical to the baseline :ref:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR Mode Commands <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.Mode_Commands>`. In addition to the
baseline :ref:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR Beam Commands <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.Beam_Commands>`, new OTH specific Beam commands allow the
user to define the ionospheric conditions, the solar characteristics, and the noise environment.

Please refer to :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` for the Multiple Beam Considerations, Mode Commands, and Radar Beam Commands. OTH
Beam Commands are discussed below.

.. block:: WSF_OTH_RADAR_SENSOR

OTH Beam Commands
=================

.. command:: noise environment <noise-environment-type>
   
   Controls the computation of galactic noise, atmospheric noise, and man-made noise. The noise is computed and applied
   ONLY if the noise environment command is used. If it is not present, no additional noise is computed.
   
   Default: quiet_rural

.. command:: solar_characteristics  ... end_solar_characteristics
   
   This command allows the initialization of time of day and day of year. These control the solar declination angle and
   the solar zenith angles used by the routine to determine if an ionospheric bounce can occur.
   
   ::
   
      solar_characteristics
         hour_of_day  <int>
         day_of_year  <int>
      end_solar_characteristics
   
   The hour_of_day is based upon the 24 hour clock, and is LOCAL time. If the solar_characteristics data block is not
   invoked, or if day_of_year and/or hour_of_day are not specified, they each default to 1 and 12, respectively, so
   January 1st, 1200 hours.

.. command:: ionosphere_characteristics  ... end_ionosphere_characteristics
   
   This command allows the initialization of data that will control if and where an ionospheric bounce can occur.
   
   ::
   
      ionosphere_characteristics
         electron_temperature                <double>
         electron_density_at_max             <double>
         electron_height_at_max              <length>
         reflection_height                   <length>
         ionosphere_constrains_minimum_range <bool>
      end_ionosphere_characteristics
   
   * **electron_temperature** is specified in degrees Kelvin. **Default is 1540 K**.
   * **electron_density_at_max** is the highest electron density measured in electrons per cubic meter. **Default is
     4.0e11**.
   * **electron_height_at_max** corresponds to the height/altitude at which maximum electron density occurs. **Default is
     250 km**.
   * **reflection_height** height/altitude used to compute the geometry for an ionospheric bounce. This is also used to
     compute minimum detection range (i.e., skip-zone distance). **Default is 300 km**.
   * **ionosphere_constrains_minimum_range** allows the setting of a computed minimum and maximum range. **Default is set
     to false**. If a minimum and/or maximum range is specified by the user, and ionosphere_constrains_minimum_range is set
     to **true**, then the user-defined range limits will be ignored and the computed ranges will be used. A warning
     statement to the user will alert them to this fact.
     
OTH Reflection Points
=====================

The estimated reflection point of the ionosphere can be accessed through the :method:`AuxDataDouble<WsfTrack.AuxDataDouble>` method on the tracks provided by the sensor. 

Example::

   double lat = track.AuxDataDouble("oth_reflection_point_lat");
   double lon = track.AuxDataDouble("oth_reflection_point_lon");
   double alt = track.AuxDataDouble("oth_reflection_point_alt");
