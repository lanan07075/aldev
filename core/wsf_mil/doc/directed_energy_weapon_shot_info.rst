Breakdown
=========

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tag
     - Description

   * - <time> 
     - current simulation time 

   * - <event>
     - simulation event recorded in this message 

   * - <firing platform>
     - name of firing platform

   * - <target platform> 
     - name of target platform. If the target has already been killed or removed from the simulation, the message "(Target Not in Simulation)" will appear instead. 

   * - <target offset>
     - name of target offset (if any) 

   * - <weapon name>
     - name of the directed energy weapon that is firing 

   * - <weapon type> 
     - type of directed energy weapon that is firing 

   * - <target type> 
     - target platform's type 

   * - <N> <E> <D> 
     - The location of the target with respect to the firing platform in local North-East-Down coordinates. These data will only be present if the target has not been killed / removed from the simulation. 

   * - <range> <bearing> <elevation>
     - The location of the target with respect to the firing platform in range, bearing, and elevation. These data will only be present if the target has not been killed / removed from the simulation. 

   * - <power> 
     - power on target 

   * - <peak irradiance>
     - irradiance at the center of the beam 

   * - <edge irradiance>
     - irradiance at the damage radius 

   * - <damage radius>
     - the radius within which the beam is effective. This is the bucket size for power in the bucket calculations 

   * - <energy density>
     - the energy density (fluence) on target for this shot 

   * - <energy> 
     - the energy on target for this shot 

   * - <semi-major axis> 
     - the longitudinal beam size on target, measured from the peak to the point at which irradiance is 1/e. This will be the beam spot size divided by the cosine of the incidence angle. 

   * - <semi-minor axis> 
     - the transverse beam size on target, measured from the peak to the point at which irradiance is 1/e.
