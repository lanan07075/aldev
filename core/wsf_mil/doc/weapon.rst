   Some weapon commands_ are not compatible with certain weapon models.
   A warning specifying incompatible commands is provided in the documentation for affected models.
   Avoid using script methods which access the parameters of incompatible commands.

Overview
========

A weapon is an object whose purpose is to destroy or disrupt enemy platforms and systems. A bomb would be an example of a weapon whose intent is to destroy while a radar jammer would be an example of a weapon whose intent is to disrupt.

Commands
========

.. command::  [ on | off ]

   Defines the initial state of the weapon when introduced into the simulation.

   **Default** 'on' for :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON`

   **Default** 'off' for :model:`WSF_RF_JAMMER`

.. command:: update_interval <time-reference>

   Specifies the update interval for those weapon types that require it.

   **Default** 0 sec.

.. command:: launch_computer <type> ... end_launch_computer
             launch_computer ... end_launch_computer

   Specifies the launch computer for those weapon types that require it.

   The first form must be given when a launch computer has yet to be defined on the weapon. '<type>' must be the name of a
   user- or pre-defined :command:`launch_computer` types.

   The second form must be used then a launch computer has already been instantiated on the weapon.

.. command:: quantity <real-reference>

   Specifies the number of rounds that are initially available.

   **Default** 0.0

.. command:: maximum_quantity <real-reference>

   Specifies the maximum number of rounds that may exist on the weapon. This is used to constrain weapon reloading.

   **Default** Infinite

.. command:: firing_delay <random-time-reference>

   This is only applicable to firing requests initiated by :method:`WsfWeapon.FireSalvo <WsfWeapon.FireSalvo>` or
   :method:`WsfTaskManager.FireAt <WsfTaskManager.FireAt>`. It specifies the time that will elapse between the time the request is
   issued and the time the first (or only) shot of the request is fired.  This may cause a weapon to be fired at a
   nonexistent track (i.e., the target platform was removed from the simulation after the Fire command was issued), which
   in turn makes the weapon have an erratic trajectory.

   **Default** 0.0 sec

.. command:: firing_interval <random-time-reference>

   Specifies the amount of time that must elapse between when a weapon last completed a firing request and when it is next
   fired.  This is different from salvo_interval_ in that this value specifies the minimum time delay that occurs
   before another Fire() request can be prosecuted.

   **Default** 0.0 sec

.. command:: salvo_interval <random-time-reference>

   This is only applicable to firing requests initiated by :method:`WsfWeapon.FireSalvo <WsfWeapon.FireSalvo>` or
   :method:`WsfTaskManager.FireAt <WsfTaskManager.FireAt>`. It specifies the time amount of time that will elapse between rounds
   in a multiple shot request. The times of each shot in a salvo will be:
   * T<sub>1</sub> = T + firing_delay
   * T<sub>2</sub> = T<sub>1</sub> + salvo_interval
   * T<sub>N</sub> = T<sub>N-1</sub> + salvo_interval

   **Default** 0.0 sec

.. command:: maximum_request_count <integer-value>

   Specifies the maximum number of salvo firing requests (:method:`WsfWeapon.FireSalvo <WsfWeapon.FireSalvo>` or
   :method:`WsfTaskManager.FireAt <WsfTaskManager.FireAt>`) that may be active simultaneously.

   **Default** 1

.. command:: automatic_target_cueing <boolean-value>

   This is only applicable to firing requests initiated by :method:`WsfWeapon.FireSalvo <WsfWeapon.FireSalvo>` or
   :method:`WsfTaskManager.FireAt <WsfTaskManager.FireAt>`.  If 'true' and if the weapon supports cueing, the weapon will be cued
   to the track specified on the request. If 'false' then the weapon will not be cued.

   **Default** true

.. command:: cue_to_predicted_intercept <boolean-value>

   If automatic_target_cueing_ is true, specify if weapon should be cued to the track location (false) or the the
   predicted intercept location (true).

   **Default** false

.. command:: unknown_target_range <length-reference>

   Specifies the range to be used for deriving a target location if either a target track was not specified on the fire
   request or if the target track was specified and did not contain enough information to derive a location.

   If a location needs to be derived, it will be formed using

   * The value of this command, and
   * The value the unknown_target_altitude_ command, and
   * Either the bearing from the supplied target track (if it is available) or the heading of the launching platform.

   **Default** none

.. command:: unknown_target_altitude <length-reference> [ agl | msl | relative ]

   Specifies the altitude to be used when deriving a target location. This command only has an effect if
   unknown_target_range_ is also specified.

   **Default** 1 m agl

.. command:: reload_increment <real-reference>

   Specifies the amount of weapons inventory taken from an External Replenishment Magazine (ERM) added to the weapon when
   a reload event occurs.

   **Default** 0

.. command:: reload_inventory <real-reference>

   Specifies the amount of weapons inventory available from an External Replenishment Magazine (ERM), the finite source
   for weapons reloading.

   **Default** 0 and disables any reload capability

.. command:: reload_threshold <real-reference>

   Specifies the amount of weapons inventory at which a reload event is started.  Reload potential is evaluated only after
   a successful weapon Fire().

   **Default** 0

.. command:: reload_time <random-time-reference>

   Specifies the time elapsed from the start of a weapon reload until the reload completes.

   **Default** 0 s

.. command:: inhibit_while_reloading <boolean-value>

   Indicates if firing is inhibited while reloading is in progress.  If this is false, firings will continue to take place
   until the available quantity is 0.  If true, any request will be ignored.

   If a salvo request is submitted (:method:`WsfWeapon.FireSalvo <WsfWeapon.FireSalvo>` or
   :method:`WsfTaskManager.FireAt <WsfTaskManager.FireAt>`), each round in a salvo is processed independently. A partial salvo may
   be aborted if:

   * The value of this command is false and the reload_threshold_ is encountered during the salvo.
   * The value of this command is true and the quantity remaining goes to zero before the salvo completes.

   **Default** false

.. command:: weapon_effects <string-reference>

   Specifies the type of the weapon_effects to be used for determining weapon effectiveness. See the page on
   :command:`weapon_effects` for more details.

   .. note::
      For :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` it is customary to place the **weapon_effects** command in the definition
      of the :command:`platform <platform.weapon_effects>`  that represents the launched weapon.
