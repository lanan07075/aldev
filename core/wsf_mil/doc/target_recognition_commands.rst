Overview
--------

Target recognition is enabled in :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` when the :command:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR.target_recognition`
flag is set to true. In this mode, the processor attempts to detect, classify, and/or identify all 'objects' (platforms) 
in the currently evaluated image. These decisions are based on the number of pixels an object's platform occupies, using 
the following Johnson's Criteria equations:

* An object is declared **DETECTED** when the following criteria are met:
    1. The object occupies the number of pixels specified in minimum_detection_pixel_count_.
    2. The object passes the Johnson criteria for 'detection'.
    3. The object has met these two criteria for the minimum time specified by detection_delay_time_.

* An object is declared **CLASSIFIED** when the following criteria are met:
    1. The object has passed the **DETECTED** state.
    2. The object occupies the minimum number of pixels specified by minimum_classification_pixel_count_.
    3. The object passes the Johnson criteria for 'classification'.
    4. The object has met the latter two criteria for the minimum time specified by classification_delay_time_.

* An object is declared **IDENTIFIED** when the following criteria are met:
    1. The object has passed the **CLASSIFIED** state.
    2. The object occupies the minimum number of pixels specified by minimum_identification_pixel_count_.
    3. The object passes the Johnson criteria for 'identification'.
    4. The object has met the latter two criteria for at least the time specified by identification_delay_time_.

When an object is declared **DETECTED**, a track is emitted over the internal link(s) that
represents the object. The track will continue to be updated and emitted as long as updates are received from the
imaging sensor. The following additional information is included in the track to indicate the current state:

==========   ===========================   ===========================   ===============
State        AuxDataDouble("CLASSIFIED")   AuxDataDouble("IDENTIFIED")   Type()
==========   ===========================   ===========================   ===============
DETECTED     -1                            -1                            "UNKNOWN"
CLASSIFIED   <time>                        -1                            <platform-type>
IDENTIFIED   <time>                        <time>                        <platform-type>
==========   ===========================   ===========================   ===============

The aux_data variables **CLASSIFIED** and **IDENTIFIED** represent the most recent time the object was categorized
in that state, with a value of -1 representing 'not in that state'.

.. note::
   In the current implementation, once an object reaches a given state, it will never be reset to a lower
   state. It is the user's responsibility to check the data and determine if the information is usable.

Commands
--------

.. command:: average_aspect_ratio <real-reference>
   
   Defines the average aspect ratio used when converting the raw pixel count from the pseudo-image into a number of line
   pairs. If *AR* is the average aspect ratio defined by this command, and *PC* is the raw pixel count from an object in the
   pseudo-image, the number of line pairs *LP* is defined to be:
   : :math:`LP = \frac{\sqrt{PC / AR} } {2}\,` 
    
   **Default** 4.0

.. command:: detection_scene_analysis_factor <real-reference>
.. command:: classification_scene_analysis_factor <real-reference>
.. command:: identification_scene_analysis_factor <real-reference>
   
   Defines the 'scene analysis factor' (SAF) in the Johnson criteria equation for detection, classification, or
   identification, respectively.  The equation is:
   
   :math:`P(LP)=(LP/SAF)^{2.7+0.7(LP/SAF)} \Big / 1+(LP/SAF)^{2.7+0.7(LP/SAF)}`
   
   Where *LP* is the number of line pairs and *SAF* is the appropriate scene analysis function.
    
   **Defaults** detection: 1.0, classification: 4.0, identification: 6.4

.. command:: minimum_detection_pixel_count <real-reference>
.. command:: minimum_classification_pixel_count <real-reference>
.. command:: minimum_identification_pixel_count <real-reference>
   
   Defines the minimum number of pixels an object must occupy in an image before it can possibly be detected,
   classified, or identified, respectively. An object must pass the pixel count test and Johnson criteria test for a given
   state.
    
   **Default** 0

.. command:: detection_delay_time <time-reference>
   
   Defines the amount of time in which an object must meet the 'detection' criteria until it is declared as **DETECTED**.
   During the delay time, detections that do not meet the 'detection' criteria will result in the state being reset back to
   **UNDETECTED** unless the transition_coast_time_ is defined.
    
   **Default** 0 seconds

.. command:: classification_delay_time <time-reference>
   
   Defines the amount of time in which an object must meet the 'classification' criteria until it is declared as
   **CLASSIFIED**. During the delay time, detections that do not meet the 'classification' criteria will result in the
   state being reset back to **DETECTED** or **UNDETECTED** (depending on the quality of the failed detections) unless the
   transition_coast_time_ is defined.
    
   **Default** 0 seconds

.. command:: identification_delay_time <time-reference>
   
   Defines the amount of time in which an object must meet the 'identification' criteria until it is declared as
   **IDENTIFIED**. During the delay time, detections that do not meet the 'identification' criteria will result in the
   state being reset back to **CLASSIFIED**, **DETECTED**, or **UNDETECTED** (depending on the quality of the failed
   detections) unless the transition_coast_time_ is defined.
    
   **Default** 0 seconds

.. command:: transition_coast_time <time-reference>
   
   Defines the amount of time the object can 'coast' without receiving an 'acceptable detection' while in a transition
   period between states (as defined by detection_delay_time_, classification_delay_time_, and identification_delay_time_). 
   An 'acceptable detection' is one that at least meets the detection criteria for the destination state.
    
   **Default** 0 seconds

.. command:: detection_coast_time <time-reference>
.. command:: classification_coast_time <time-reference>
.. command:: identification_coast_time <time-reference>
   
   Defines the amount of time an object can remain in a state without receiving a detection that does not meet the Johnson
   criteria for that state.
    
   **Default** 0 seconds

   .. note::
      This is currently an investigative capability and does not affect the produced track.
