Overview
========

The false_target_screener block specifies the characteristics of a false target screener.  The false target
screener is responsible for determining how a :command:`false_target` is interpreted by targeted radars.  For false targets
to affect a radar a false_target_screener block must be defined within the :command:`sensor` block.

The screener manages the radar's ability to develop and transfer target tracks for both real and false targets.  The
number of target tracks developed and transferred by the radar is determined by the track_capacity and
transfer_capacity inputs.  The screener utilizes these capacities in addition to the total number of real and false
targets detected to determine the number of tracks (real and false) to be maintained and transferred by the radar. **A
real target that has a range from the sensor that is less than that of the closest false target will be allowed as a
track.**

Real target track probabilities are calculated based on the number of detectable false target blips (i.e., trackable
blips) are impinging upon the sensor and the number of real targets per the following. If the number of false target
blips plus the number of real targets are less than the track_capacity_ then all the false targets and real
targets will be allowed to be tracked. If on the other hand the number of false targets plus the number of real targets
exceeds the track_capacity_ then the following equation is applied to see how many real targets will be allowed
through::

  *AllowedRealTargets = (integer) (track_capacity_ * NumberOfRealTargets / (NumberOfRealTargets + NumberFalseTargets*))

Commands
========

.. command:: debug

   Set debug mode.

.. command:: plot_capacity <real-value>

   Specifies the total number of targets (real and false) which will be allowed to be displayed at a given time.

   **Default:** 1000

.. command:: track_capacity <real-value>

   Specifies the total number of targets the radar can track at a given time.

   **Default:** 1000

.. command:: transfer_capacity <real-value>

   Specifies the total number of targets the radar is allowed to pass to a command or :model:`fusion center <WSF_FUSION_CENTER>`.

   **Default:** 250

.. command:: initial_reject <behavior-type> <real-value>

   *<behavior-type>* : A string input of the false-target behavior-type the following data applies to, valid values are
   **["random_scan_to_scan" | "consistent_scan_to_scan"]**.
   Specifies an initial rejection ratio which characterizes the screener's ability to initially reject some number of
   false targets configured with the specified **<behavior-type>**. An input of 'random_scan_to_scan 0.10' would allow the
   screener to reject 10% of false targets configured with 'random_scan_to_scan behavior' whether detected or not by the
   sensor.

   **Default:** 0.0

.. command:: reject <behavior-type> <real-value>

   <behavior-type>
       A string input of the false-target blip behavior-type the following data applies to, valid values
       are **["random_scan_to_scan" | "consistent_scan_to_scan"]**.
       Specifies a rejection ratio which characterizes the screener's ability to reject some number of total false target
       blips configured with the specified **<behavior-type>** each update of the screener. An input of 'random_scan_to_scan
       0.10' would allow the screener to reject 10% of false targets blips that are being detected by the sensor with
       'random_scan_to_scan behavior'.

   **Default:** 0.0

.. command:: allow_track_reporting_when_flooded <boolean-value>

   Specifies as to whether or not false target tracks are to be reported when the transfer capacity is met. If '**true**'
   the screener will allow the :command:`sensor's <sensor>` to report a number of randomly selected tracks up to the transfer
   capacity each frame; if '**false** then the screener will not allow the :command:`sensor's <sensor>` tracker to report any
   tracks if transfer capacity is exceeded. The current track capacity includes active and forced false and real targets.

   **Default:** true

.. command:: request_based_tracking <boolean-value>

   Specifies as to whether the radar/screener should collect all trackable false targets based on track requests. If set
   'true' will cause false targets to only be screened if a request has been scheduled for a track to be initially
   detected or updated. Primarily used for tracking type radars and radars that respond to requests only.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: only_screen_false_target_track_requests <boolean-value>

   Specifies as to whether the radar/screener should collect all false targets (i.e., 'false') or just the ones in which
   requests have been made (i.e., 'true'). If set 'true' will cause only the requested false target to only be screened.
   Primarily used for tracking type radars and radars that respond to requests only.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: force_target_tracks ... end_force_target_tracks

   Defines the conditions in which a target track can be forced to be tracked by the :command:`false_target_screener`. To define the dispersion,

   .. parsed-literal::

       force_target_tracks
          range_force_ *<range-type>*
          sector_force_ *<angle-value>* *<integer-value>*
          range_sector_force_ *<length-value>* *<angle-value>* *<integer-value>*
          j_to_s_delta_threshold_ *<db-ratio-value>*
       end_force_target_tracks

   .. command:: range_force <range-type>

      Specifies the range_type criteria that will check to see if a target track should be forced or not based on false
      target blip constraining. Allowed types are:

      * **none**                                    - No forcing of target tracks due to range constraining of blips.
      * **inside_blip_range**                       - If a target track is inside the minimum blip range it will be forced.
      * **outside_blip_range**                      - If a target track is outside the maximum blip range it will be forced.
      * **both** or **inside_outside_blip_range** - If a target track is inside or outside the minimum or maximum blip range
        respectively it will be forced.

      **Default:** none

   .. command:: sector_force <angle-value> <integer-value>

      Specifies the sector arc, centered around the target track location, along with the maximum false target count in which
      the target track will be forced.

      **Default:** No sector forcing

   .. command:: range_sector_force <length-value> <angle-value> <integer-value>

      Specifies the range extent and sector arc, centered around the target track location, along with the maximum false
      target count in which the target track will be forced.

      **Default:** No sector forcing

   .. command:: j_to_s_delta_threshold <db-ratio-value>

      Specifies the J/S delta in which the false targets will be **counted** within the defined sector, for use by the sector
      forcing commands input maximum false target counts. Any false target with a J/S within the delta threshold defined will
      count towards a competing false target within the sector of interest.

      .. note::
         It is necessary to have the :command:`sensor_mode.reports_signal_to_noise` flag
         set to enable the J/S checks.

      **Default:** No J/S checks
