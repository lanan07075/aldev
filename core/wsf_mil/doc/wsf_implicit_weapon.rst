Overview
========

:model:`WSF_IMPLICIT_WEAPON` represents a :command:`weapon` that does not require an independent flyout.  There is no weapon
platform created for implicit weapons.  Often, they are simply fired directly at a particular target rather than using
a track to provide other information such as target coordinates.
Implicit weapons are often used with launch computers (e.g., indirect fire weapons modeled as implicit).
In this case, engagements are evaluated at the time specified by the launch computer's time to
intercept calculation.  By default, if no launch computer is used, engagements are evaluated on the update_interval of
the weapon (if specified).  However, derived weapon models, such as the :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON` (where engagement
evaluations are done at a specified interval), may provide their own implementation.

Commands
========

.. command:: launched_platform_type <string-reference>

   As documented in :command:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON<WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON.launched_platform_type>`, this command specifies the type of platform to be created when a weapon of
   this type is launched.  Although implicit weapons do not create new platforms, this command may be required if the implicit
   weapon uses a launch computer.  Launch computer documentation will list this requirement if applicable.

   **Default:** No default. Must be specified if required.

.. command:: quantity <real-reference>

   This command is identical to :command:`weapon.quantity`; however, the default value for implicit weapons is different.

   **Default:** Value of :command:`weapon.maximum_quantity`
