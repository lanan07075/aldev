Reference Values
----------------

Overview
========

.. note::
   The WSF :ref:`WSF_User_Input_Format.Pre-Processor` (introduced in AFSIM 1.9.0) provide a better and more general
   way to accomplish what is provided by this capability. Please consider using it if possible.

`Reference Values`_ is a feature added in :ref:`wsf_1.7.3` that provides a mechanism for the value of some WSF
commands to be defined at run-time from the value of a :ref:`ScriptVariables`. The primary motivation for
this feature is to support the situation where an an analyst may want to vary the value of one or more parameters from
run-to-run (design of experiments). Prior to the implementation of this feature the analyst had to update the affected
files with the desired values, run the application, update the files with the next values, run the application and so
on. This was very error prone, especially if there were a large number of files. Another motivation is to be able to
provide 'base types' that represent some nominal configuration, but to provide the ability to temporarily override the
configuration without modifying the original definition (which may be in a shared storage area referenced by multiple
users).

The best way to demonstrate the use of reference values is through a simple example. One common simulation technique is
to use a delay time to model the time that it takes to perform some function. In this example, an analyst has inserted
a delay to simulate the time that it takes to assimilate information before it can act on it. Platforms of type
COMMANDER receive track information from offboard sources, use it to update its *operating picture* (using
:model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`), and then act on the information (using :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR`). As defined below, there is a
fixed 5 second 'assimilation' delay.

.. parsed-literal::

 platform_type COMMANDER WSF_PLATFORM
    comm radio WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER
       internal_link delay_proc
    end_comm

    processor delay_proc :model:`WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR`
       process
          select type WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE end_select
          select type WSF_TRACK_DROP_MESSAGE end_select
          delay_time 5.0 sec
          internal_link track_proc
       end_process
       default_process
          internal_link task_proc
       end_default_process
    end_processor

    processor track_proc :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`
       ...
    end_processor

    processor task_proc :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR`
       ...
    end_processor
 end_platform_type

If platforms of this type were used in a simulation one would get a fixed 5 second delay between the time the track was
received and the time when the task processor could make a decision. Now let us say we want to see what will happen if
we vary the time to see what happens if the delay is 5, 10, 15 or 20 seconds. First, change the *delay_time 5.0 sec* to
read::

 delay_time /variable PROCESSING_TIME /default 5.0 sec

Then, in the master input file (e.g., master.txt) add the following commands::

 script_variables
    double PROCESSING_TIME = 0.0;
 end_script_variables

 on_initialize
    PROCESSING_TIME = 5.0 * WsfSimulation.RunNumber();   // will take values of 5, 10, 15 and 20
 end_on_initialize

 initial_run_number 1
 final_run_number 4

Better yet, put the above commands in a separate file (e.g., multi_run.txt) and run the simulation using the following
command::

 sage master.txt multi_run.txt

The above example uses the :ref:`Monte_Carlo_Iteration` to run 4 iterations within one
invocation of the executable. In more complex cases the user may want to create a file for each case (e.g.,
case-<n>.txt) which contains a :ref:`ScriptVariables` block that contains the variable definitions for that case. This
would work very well if the desired cases weren't a simple multi-dimensional matrix. Then each case would be run
separately::

 sage master.txt case-1.txt
 sage master.txt case-2.txt
  ...
 sage maser.txt case-<n>.txt

Maintaining a separate file for each case also makes it easier to see exactly which parameters were used for the case.

Syntax
======

To describe the new syntax we will consider the :command:`processor.update_interval` command contained in :command:`processor`.
Prior to the implementation of reference values it was defined as:

 **update_interval** <time-value>

With the implementation of reference values, the documentation now reads:

 **update_interval** <time-reference>

The value for commands that now accept reference values will appear as *<X-reference>* in the description. The
value for commands that do not accept a reference value will appear as *<X-value>* in the description. In the
reference section for <time-reference> one will see there are two possible formats. The first form is to be used when
entering a fixed value:

 <time-value>

The second form is used to request that the value be assigned at run-time from a variable of the supplied name.

 /variable *<variable-name>* /default <time-value>

The clause '/default <time-value>' is optional. It indicates that if the variable specified by *<variable-name>*
cannot be found then the supplied default will be used.

Given the above, the following are valid forms for **update_interval**::

 update_interval 1.0 sec
 update_interval /variable THINKER_UPDATE_INTERVAL /default 1.0 sec
 update_interval /variable THINKER_UPDATE_INTERVAL

Resolving A Variable Reference
==============================

When a variable reference is used, the value of the command is determined (*resolved*) at run-time rather than when the
command is read. In particular, it is resolved when the containing object (e.g., platform, mover, processor, sensor) is
added to the running simulation. When attempting to resolve a reference, the software will start in the current script
context and proceed upward looking for the variable of the supplied name. In **most** cases this means that it will
first look for a script variable at the platform level, and then look at the global level. There are some exceptions
that will be defined later.

If the variable is successfully located, it is simply **copied** to the command value. Three very important things must
be noted:

* It is copied only once when it is resolved during simulation initialization. If the variable is subsequently changed
  during the simulation, it will not affect the value of the command.
* The value of the script variable must be in the internal units required by the command (the expected units are
  documented in :ref:`argument_types.reference_values`. Time must be in seconds, length in meters, mass in kilograms, angles
  in radians.
* Normal validity checking of values is not performed. The user is expected to enter a valid value.

If the variable could not be located then the default value specified by '/default' will be used if it was provided. If
no default was provided then object initialization will fail with an error message and the simulation will be
terminated.

The values of resolved variable references will be written to the simulation log file as defined by :command:`log_file`.
This will serve as a source for the user to check to see if the expected values were assigned to the
commands.

Exceptions in resolving variables
=================================

There are some exceptions to starting context for variable resolution.

* The :command:`platform` commands :command:`platform.creation_time` and :command:`weapons_effects <platform>` always resolve from the
  global level.
* The :command:`mover` command :command:`_.route_mover.start_time` always resolves from the global level.
* Commands that are defined by processors that derive from :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR` start searching at the processor
  level, and then proceed to the platform level and finally the global level. Note, however, commands are defined in the
  parents of :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR` (i.e., :command:`processor` and :ref:`Platform_Part_Commands` ) still
  start at the platform level.
