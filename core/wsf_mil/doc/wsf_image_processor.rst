Overview
========

:model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` receives image data from an imaging sensor such as :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` or :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR`
and produces tracks. This provides a simple capability to simulate an analyst looking at the image and generating
actionable information. The capabilities of the :model:`WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR` can be used to simulate processing delays by
delaying the reception of the incoming image messages.

The processor is typically used in the following construct:

.. parsed-literal::

   platform_type ...
      sensor eoir :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR`
         ...
         # Forward the images to 'image_proc'
         internal_link image_proc
      end_sensor

      processor image_proc :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR`
         ...
         # Forward the extracted 'tracks' to 'track_proc'
         internal_link track_mgr
      end_processor

      processor track_proc :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`
         ...
         # Implicitly takes the tracks from 'image_proc' and updates the track_manager
      end_processor
   end_platform_type

The processor accepts the following of messages:

* :class:`WSF_IMAGE_MESSAGE <WsfImageMessage>`

  A static image from :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` operating in 'spot' mode.

* :class:`WSF_VIDEO_MESSAGE <WsfVideoMessage>`

  A single frame of a video stream from :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` or from :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` operating in 'strip' mode.

Each of the above messages contains a :class:`WsfImage` object, which reflects the objects that were visible in the image.
The processor then creates or updates tracks for each object in the image as defined in the following sections.

If the target_recognition_ flag is enabled, the :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` will attempt to perform
target detection, identification, and classification, based on the number of pixels in the evaluated image and
associated Johnson's criteria equations (see :ref:`target_recognition_commands`).

.. note::

   Only WSF_IMAGE_MESSAGE and WSF_VIDEO_MESSAGE message types are processed by WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR.
   Incoming messages of all other types are discarded.

Static Image Processing
=======================

For static images the process is simple. For each object in the image:

* Create a new temporary track with a new track ID.
* Set the reported location in the track to the 'measured' location from the image.
* Set the reported velocity in the track to zero.
* Set the reported type and side if requested.
* Send a :class:`WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE <WsfTrackMessage>` containing a new track.

Note that every object in every static image gets a unique track ID. No memory is retained about formerly processed
static images.

Video Stream Processing
=======================

For video streams, the following process is repeated for each object in the image:

* If there is not an existing track for the object, create the track, and if requested, initiate a filter.
* If a filter is defined:

   * Update the filter with the 'measured' location from the object in the image.
   * Update the track with the location and velocity estimate from the filter.
   * Update the track with the state and residual covariance (this may be suppressed while the filter is not 'mature'.)

* If a filter is not defined:

   * Update the track with the 'measured' location from the object in the image.
   * If 'reports_velocity' was specified, update the track with the true velocity that corresponds to the platform
     associated with the object.

* Set the reported type and side if requested.
* Send a :class:`WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE <WsfTrackMessage>` with the new or updated track.

After processing all the objects in the image, old tracks are purged. Any track in which the time since last updated
exceeds the coast_time_ is purged, and a :class:`WSF_DROP_TRACK_MESSAGE <WsfTrackDropMessage>` is sent.

.. block:: WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR

Commands
========

.. command:: coast_time <time-value>

   Specifies the maximum amount of time that may elapse between updates before a track is dropped.

   Tracks are evaluated for dropping only when a message containing an object is received.

   Default: 0 secs (no coast time)

.. command:: filter <filter_type> <filter_parameters> end_filter

   A filter can be used to take an incoming video stream to produce smoothed position and velocity estimates.
   *<filter-type>* can be one of the :ref:`Predefined_Filter_Types` or a :command:`filter` derived from one of those types.

   Default: No filter.

   .. note::

      Filters are not applied to static images.

.. command:: reports_velocity

   Indicates if velocity is reported in the produced tracks.

   This command is applicable ONLY the input is a video stream and a filter_ has not been defined. Velocity will
   ALWAYS be reported in the following cases:

   * If a filter_ is defined, and enough updates have been received to generate a reliable velocity. This means that
     initialize, and perhaps for one or two updates, the track will not have :method:`WsfTrack.VelocityValid`.
   * For static images, a velocity of zero will be reported.

.. command:: reports_type

   Indicates if 'type' is to be reported in the produced tracks.

   Default: 'type' will not reported.

.. command:: reports_side

   Indicates if 'side' is to be reported in the produced tracks.

   Default: 'side' will not reported.

.. command:: reports_bearing_elevation

   Indicates that tracks are to be populated with bearing and elevation instead of location data.

   .. note::

      This feature should not be used with filtering.

   Default: Location is reported instead of bearing and elevation

.. command:: message_length <data-size-value>

   Specify the logical length assigned to the track messages that are created from the image.

   Default: 0 (use the value derived from the :command:`message_table` )

.. command:: message_priority <integer-priority>

   Specify the priority assigned to the track messages that are created from the image.

   Default: 0 (use the value derived from the :command:`message_table` )

.. command:: include_unstable_covariance <boolean-value>

.. command:: include_unstable_residual_covariance <boolean-value>

   When a filter is employed, the state covariance and residual covariance are not reliable during initial creation and
   perhaps for one or two updates (the number depends on the filter employed). When these values are false (the default),
   these unreliable values are not passed to the output track.

   Default: false for both commands.

.. command:: target_recognition <boolean-value>

   Enable this processor's :ref:`target recognition <target_recognition_commands>` capabilities for target detection,
   classification, and identification.

.. _WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR.Script_Interface:

Script Interface
================

:model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` utilizes the capabilities of the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface`, :model:`WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR` and
:model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`.
