Overview
========

Implements a low-fidelity air mover, much like :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`.  But the :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER` was found to have
non-smooth motion when lateral and vertical maneuvers were combined, necessitating this alternative.  The underlying
dynamics model is essentially a quaternion orientation that is permitted to rotate only at constrained angular rates in
inertial space, and the velocity vector is directed in the "forward" direction from this quaternion.  No aerodynamics
or propulsion is modeled.  This permits smooth turns to be made in lateral and vertical directions.  The magnitude of
the accelerations are determined by internal pursuit and proportional navigation gains, and the target point in three
dimensions is determined by the :ref:`Route_Mover` waypoint-switching logic.

This initial draft is not complete, and does not implement all guidance possible while switching waypoints within a
:command:`route`.  It does respond to (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude (MSL-only)) waypoints, and honors speed commands.  It
ignores heading, distance, time, climb rates, flight path angles, and acceleration commands.

Velocity vector turn rates are constrained to the most restrictive of maximum_lateral_acceleration_,
maximum_axial_body_roll_rate_, and maximum_axial_body_turn_rate_, and ever increasing current platform
speed will force the platform motion to approach a straight line if maximum_lateral_acceleration_ is held
constant.

Some comments on setting appropriate velocity_pursuit_gain_ (VP) and proportional_navigation_gain_ (PN)
values is in order.  These two gains will conflict with each other, and achieving proper values may be a trial and
error process.  "Saturation" my occur if the velocity vector constraints (see paragraph above) are so severe that the
requested VP or PN requested accelerations are not achievable.  Setting VP and PN to zero would be pointless, as
platform motion would not turn to intercept the target.  Begin by setting PN to zero, and VP small, and increase VP
until turn aggressiveness toward the target point is sufficient to intercept.  If the target point is stationary (such
as for a fixed waypoint), calibration is complete.  For moving or accelerating target motion, pure VP will result in a
sweeping turn to approach the target from behind.  At this time, begin increasing PN until the platform "anticipates"
the impact point, and flies to intercept in a straight line (provided the target is also moving in a straight line). 
In this respect, PN is "better" than VP.  The temptation is to fly only PN, with no VP, but if the target point begins
behind the velocity vector (azimuth or elevation greater than 90 degrees), PN will settle into flying 180 degrees
_away_ from the target.  Generally, a brief period of VP is flown to get the platform moving toward the target, and
then VP is ramped out, while PN is ramped in, so terminal intercept is pure PN.

(Only of interest to software developers, the :model:`WSF_MATH_3D_MOVER` class is a facade, and the underlying motion
dynamics are implemented by the UtMath3D_Motion utility, which processes the input stream commands below.)

Commands
========

.. command:: detailed_debug <boolean-value>
   
   Enables debug output to the standard output.

.. command:: prefer_canopy_up <boolean-value>
   
   Causes the platform to roll to the local vertical at all times.  Mutually exclusive to bank_to_turn_.

.. command:: bank_to_turn <boolean-value>
   
   Causes the platform to roll into the acceleration vector, but still prefers the vertical when not accelerating in a
   turn.  Mutually exclusive to prefer_canopy_up_.

.. command:: broach_at_sea_level <boolean-value>
   
   Betraying the development of this class to model torpedo motion, this flag assures that the motion must remain below
   local sea level, once subsurface.

.. command:: target_speed <speed-value>
   
   Once supplied, the platform will accelerate or decelerate match the target speed, subject to
   maximum_linear_acceleration_ constraint.

.. command:: initial_speed <speed-value>
   
   Initial linear speed.  After initialization, speed is varied to maintain target_speed_.

.. command:: initial_flight_path_angle <angle-value>
   
   Initial flight path angle.  After initialization, flight path angle will vary to guide to desired waypoint.

.. command:: maximum_linear_acceleration <acceleration-value>
   
   Defines the linear (velocity direction) acceleration limit constraint.
   
   Default: 0.25 G

.. command:: maximum_lateral_acceleration <acceleration-value>
   
   Defines the lateral (normal to velocity direction) acceleration limit constraint.  This constraint is imposed
   simultaneously with maximum_axial_body_turn_rate_, the most restrictive is used.
   
   Default: 8.0 G

.. command:: maximum_axial_body_roll_rate <angular-rate-value>
   
   Defines the maximum rate at which the platform will try to capture desired target bank angle.
   
   Default: 180 deg/sec

.. command:: maximum_axial_body_turn_rate <angular-rate-value>
   
   Defines the maximum rate at which the velocity vector will rotate in three-dimensional space.  This constraint is
   imposed simultaneously with maximum_lateral_acceleration_, the most restrictive is used.
   
   Default: 45 deg/sec

.. command:: velocity_pursuit_gain <non-negative-value>
   
   Defines the factor of proportion between target azimuth and elevation (in radians), and the applied lateral or vertical
   acceleration (in m/sec^2) to null the velocity vector to point at the target.  See comments in header above.
   
   Default: 4.0

.. command:: proportional_navigation_gain <non-negative-value>
   
   Defines the factor of proportion between the target line-of-sight-rate (in rad/sec), and the applied lateral or
   vertical acceleration (in m/sec^2) to null the velocity vector to intercept the target's future position at time of
   intercept.  See comments in header above.
   
   Default: 40.0

.. command:: use_route <route-name>
   
   Supplies the name of the route to follow. The route is assumed to be a predefined absolute route.
