    :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_XMTR <WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` and
    :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_RCVR <WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` are transmit-only and receive-only versions of
    :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER`.

Overview
========
    
:model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` provides a baseline radio implementation that is capable of both transmitting and
receiving using a :command:`_.transmitter` and :command:`_.receiver`. If a communication device is required to transmit or receive only,
the :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_XMTR <WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` and :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_RCVR <WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER>` types are
available. Both of these types are special cases of the :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` type and therefore share the
same commands that are listed below in the command section.

The :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` inherits from :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER` and accepts
keywords from the parent classes.  Testing has been limited to the function of passing messages between an airborne
platform and a second platform that can be at any altitude.  Behaviors using more complex routing functions have not
been verified.

The :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` provides a communications option that overrides the traditional horizon constraints
to permit simulated communications with submerged submarines.  Most WSF sensor and communications systems were
designed to operate above the earth's surface.  Thus, when altitudes of transmitters or receivers have values of zero
or less, then constraints are usually imposed to stop any further processing of the sensing or communications event. 
When two communications systems are of the :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` type, then messages can be delivered to
platforms that are below the earth's surface.

Two basic methods of communications are considered within this single communications type--very low frequency (VLF) and
optical lasers.  Both methods are intended to permit users to achieve communications "effects" for simulations. 
Neither has high fidelity to model the physics involved with the propagation of the waves.

The VLF communication mode results in near-perfect communications that are unconstrained by horizons or terrain.  The
mode is activated using the keyword :command:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER.set_VLF_comm`.  When in the VLF mode of operations, constraints are not
imposed for absorption, attenuation, or horizon-angle limits.

The default state for :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER` results in the state such that VLF communications behavior is not
set (:command:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER.unset_VLF_comm`) and thus, a set of path constraints will be imposed.  The path constraints are intended to
provide top-level "effects" that impose constraints which are intended to be consistent with effects for a
laser-communications system.  Laser-light energy is rapidly absorbed by water.  The underwater path lengths (often only
a few hundred feet) are usually very short.  Unfortunately, the short underwater-transmission-path distances are often
within the margins of errors for many range and earth-horizon calculations that are used in mission-level simulations.

Simplifying assumptions are made to permit and to restrict communication events when **not** operating as VLF:

* The intersection of a spherical-earth surface with the straight-line path between transmitter and receiver is used to
  calculate a distance for the path through the water.  This path is used for underwater range limits and the water-path
  absorption effects. The remainder of the slant-range is used for atmospheric absorption effects.
* The method ignores detailed refraction effects, and it also ignores interactions for specific absorption and
  reflections as the energy penetrates the waves at the air-water boundary.  These values are currently within the noise
  of other error sources.  Therefore, detailed laser engineering-level models are more appropriate for study of these
  features.
* The transmission distance is assumed to be approximated by spherical-one-earth-radius horizon distances between
  platforms. If terrain models are included, the terrain is allowed to block the path along the airborne part of the path.
* Users can limit the communications capabilities that might be caused by water-entry-angle limits by using the keyword
  minimum_horizon_angle_. This angle is measured from the horizon upward.  Communications with angles less than this
  limit are stopped.  The effect is to require platforms to reduce their slant range to be able to communicate.
* Unrealistically long underwater ranges can be restricted by using the keyword max_underwater_range_filter_. 
  This range is limited to 1000 meters by default, and users can increase or decrease the value as desired.  This keyword
  has an additional effect of permitting communication over the short range without regard to horizon or terrain.

.. block:: WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER

Commands
========
      
.. command:: max_underwater_range_filter <length-value>
   
   Prevents unrealistically long underwater ranges by specifying a range constraint for the underwater portion of the
   transmission path.  This keyword also has an additional effect of permitting communication over the short range without
   regard to horizon or terrain.

   .. note::
   
      In addition to restricting ranges based on underwater path lengths, users can also restrict the total
      range by using the :command:`_.antenna_commands.maximum_range` keyword in the :command:`_.transmitter` or :command:`_.receiver` block.
   
   Default:  1000 m

.. command:: max_communication_depth <length-value>
   
   Specifies the maximum depth at which a submerged platform is permitted to exchange communication events.  In order to
   reduce user input issues, the absolute value of the numeric input is used, and the value is converted to be a negative
   altitude to represent the depth below the surface for the submerged platform.
   
   Default:  negative infinity

.. command:: minimum_horizon_angle <angle-value>
   
   Specifies the minimum angle acceptable for transmissions through the water's surface.  This angle is measured from the
   horizon upward.  Communications with angles less than this limit are stopped.  The effect is to require platforms to
   reduce their slant range to be able to communicate.
   
   Default:  -90 deg

.. command:: set_VLF_comm
.. command:: unset_VLF_comm
   
   When the command is set_VLF_comm, then all horizon checks are ignored and the message is delivered.
   
   Default:  unset_VLF_comm

.. command:: water_attenuation_factor <dbratio-value>/<length-value>
   
   Specifies a factor by which signals are attenuated as they pass through the water part of the transmission path.  The
   format for data is a number followed by a dB ratio value, followed by a backslash, and then followed by a
   <length-value>.

    A sample entry is::

      water_attenuation_factor  0.5 dB/m
   
   Default:  0.0 dB/m

Examples
========

The VLF communications option is activated by :command:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER.set_VLF_comm` on :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER`.

::

   comm VLF_COMM WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER
        debug
        set_VLF_comm  // Disables horizon checks for long-range comms
        transmitter
           frequency      30.0 khz
           //power          10.0 kw  // S/N and jamming are not modeled for VLF at current time
        end_transmitter
        receiver
           frequency      30.0 khz
           //maximum_range   500 km  //Can limit VLF range
        end_receiver
        //max_communication_depth  -400 ft  //Can enforce a depth limit
   end_comm

Operations with the optical-line-of-sight communications option is the default for :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_RADIO_TRANSCEIVER`.
