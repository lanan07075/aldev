Overview
========

:model:`WSF_OLD_UNGUIDED_MOVER` implements a mover that is capable of representing an unguided "dumb" bomb, or a single or
multistage unguided rocket.  It will accept the same commands appropriate to :model:`WSF_OLD_GUIDED_MOVER`, so consult that
related documentation for assistance.  This mover lacks any ability to generate a side force to maneuver to intercept a
target, its "guidance" capability is disabled by default, and cannot be re-enabled, causing its trajectory to be
ballistic when propulsion (if any) has burned out.
