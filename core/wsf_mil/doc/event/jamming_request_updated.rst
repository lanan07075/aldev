*All Events*

::

 <time> <event> <platform name> weapon: <weapon name>
  Mode: <current mode name> Active Requests: <count of EM transmitters>
  Frequency: {<frequency * 1E-9> " ghz" | <frequency * 1E-6> " mhz" | <frequency * 1E-3> " khz" | <frequency> " hz"
  Bandwidth: {<bandwidth * 1E-9> " ghz" | <bandwidth * 1E-6> " mhz" | <bandwidth> * 1E-3> " khz" | <bandwidth> " hz"
  *If Target is valid:*
  Target: <target name>

Breakdown
=========

<time>
    current simulation time
<event>
    simulation event that occurred
<platform name>
    name of platform that contains jammer
weapon: <weapon name>
    name of jammer (jammers are modeled as weapons)
Mode: <current mode name>
    current jammer mode
Active Requests: <count of EM transmitters>
    number of jammer transmitters (current jammer mode only)
Frequency: <frequency> <units>
    frequency of jammer request and frequency units
Bandwidth: <bandwidth> <units>
    transmitter bandwidth

*Following is added to message only if a valid **Target** was selected*

Target: target name <target name>
    name of sensor that is being jammed
