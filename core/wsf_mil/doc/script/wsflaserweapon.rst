WsfLaserWeapon
--------------

.. class:: WsfLaserWeapon inherits WsfDirectedEnergyWeapon

General Methods
===============

.. method:: bool CanLase()
   
   Return whether the Laser is capable of lasing.  It will return false if the thermal "magazine" of the the laser has
   been expended (in which case it must cool down for a given period of time).

.. method:: bool TargetOccluded(string aTargetName, string aTargetOffset)
   
   Return whether "aTargetOffset" is occluded, based on a raycast from the laser weapon to the target offset location.
   
   .. note::

      This method only produces reliable results when an intersect mesh is used, and a
      :model:`WSF_INTERSECT_PROCESSOR` is placed on the target platform.

   .. note::

      This method does not check for line-of-sight occlusion from such things as terrain or horizon.  It
      only targets self-occlusion.



Engagement Summary Methods
==========================

These methods can be used to query the results of an engagement.

.. comment The following used to be in the documentation, but 'Test Methods' was not defined...
   Typically, they are used to collect data after calls to the `Test Methods`_ but can also be used with standard WSF engagements.

.. method:: double EdgeRadius()
   
   Return the edge radius or characteristic size of the beam on target.  It is defined to be the width between the peak
   and the radius at which the power is 1/e of the peak power.

.. method:: double EnergyDensity()
   
   Return the energy density (in joules / m^2) within the target area.

.. method:: double Power()
   
   Return the average power within the target area.

.. method:: double PeakFluence()
   
   Return the peak fluence (in watts / m^2) on target.

.. method:: double IncidenceAngle()
	
   Return the incidence angle (in degrees) of the laser on the target.
