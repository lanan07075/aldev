WsfQuantumTask
--------------

.. class:: WsfQuantumTask inherits WsfTask

Overview
========

:class:`WsfQuantumTask` is used by :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` to represent a task with a priority and accessible type.
Quantum Tasks automatically generate a unique id for themselves if they were constructed with a task type and a track.
If the user exercises either of the two simpler constructors listed above and a track is not given to the quantum
task, then the user should call SetUniqueId() on the created task.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfQuantumTask Construct(double aPriority)
            static WsfQuantumTask Construct(double aPriority, string aType)
            static WsfQuantumTask Construct(double aPriority, string aType, WsfTrack aTargetTrack)
   
   Static methods to create a quantum task.  'aType' is the task type, also equivalent with resource type. (weapon,
   sensor, jammer, or none)

.. method:: double Priority()
   
   Returns the priority of the quantum task.

.. method:: void Priority(double aPriority)
   
   Sets the priority of the quantum task.

.. method:: void UniqueId(int aUniqueId)
   
   Sets the id of the quantum task (hopefully the user makes it unique).  This is necessary if the task does not have a
   track associated with it.

.. method:: string ResourceType()
   
   Returns the resource type (equivalent with task type) as a string.  Expected values: "weapon", "sensor", "jammer", or
   "unknown".
