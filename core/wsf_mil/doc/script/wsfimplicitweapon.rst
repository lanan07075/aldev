WsfImplicitWeapon
-----------------

.. class:: WsfImplicitWeapon inherits WsfWeapon

Methods
=======

.. method:: bool Fire(string aTargetName)
   
   Fire the weapon at a target.  If a launch computer is associated with the :model:`weapon <WSF_IMPLICIT_WEAPON>` definition,
   the engagement will automatically terminate after the estimated engagement time from the launch computer.  Otherwise,
   one needs to call :method:`CeaseFire <WsfWeapon.CeaseFire>` to terminate the engagement.

.. method:: bool Fire(string aTargetName, string aTargetOffset)
   
   Fire the weapon at a target, specifying a targeted offset or sub-component of the platform.  This form of
   :method:`Fire <WsfImplicitWeapon.Fire>` is appropriate when using directed energy weapons (e.g., :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON`).
