WsfTask
-------

.. class:: WsfTask
   :cloneable:

:class:`WsfTask` is used by :class:`WsfTaskManager` to represent a task. It is included in various task messages and has script
methods.  WsfTask is further specialized to provide access to weapon, jamming, and uplinking parameters.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int TaskId()

   Returns the serial number of the task.

.. method:: WsfTrackId TrackId()

   Returns the track ID as known by the assigner.

.. method:: WsfTrackId LocalTrackId()

   Returns the track ID as known by the assignee.

.. method:: string TaskType()

   Returns the 'task type' from the :method:`WsfTaskManager::AssignTask <WsfTaskManager.AssignTask>` method.

.. method:: void SetTaskType(string aTaskType)

   Sets the 'task type'.  To be used prior to :method:`WsfTaskManager::AssignTask <WsfTaskManager.AssignTask>`

.. method:: WsfPlatform Assigner()

   Returns the platform that made the assignment.

   .. note::

      This returned value may be a null reference if the platform has been deleted. Use
      :method:`IsValid() <WsfObject.IsValid>` to ensure it is valid.


.. method:: string AssignerName()

   Returns the name of the platform that made the assignment.

.. method:: WsfPlatform Assignee()

   Returns the platform to which the task was assigned.

   .. note::

      This returned value may be a null reference if the platform has been deleted. Use
      :method:`IsValid() <WsfObject.IsValid>` to ensure it is valid.

.. method:: string AssigneeName()

   Returns the name of the platform to which the task was assigned.

.. method:: void SetAssignee(WsfPlatform aAssignee)

   Sets the assignee of the task.  To be used prior to :method:`WsfTaskManager::AssignTask <WsfTaskManager.AssignTask>`.

.. method:: void SetAssignee(string aAssignee)

   Sets the platform name of the task assignee.  To be used prior to
   :method:`WsfTaskManager::AssignTask <WsfTaskManager.AssignTask>`.

.. method:: string Status()

   Returns the task's status.  Possible values are: "ACCEPTED", "REJECTED", "COMPLETED", "IN_PROGRESS",
   "ACKNOWLEDGE_CANCEL", "ACKNOWLEDGE_COMPLETE", "WEAPON_RELEASED", "SUCCESSFUL", or "UNSUCCESSFUL".

.. method:: string SubStatus()

   Returns the task's sub-status.  This is a user-defined status string set by methods like
   :method:`WsfTaskManager.TaskComplete`.

.. method:: double TimeAssigned()

   Returns the simulation time when the task was assigned.

.. method:: double TimeUpdated()

   Returns the simulation time when the task was last updated.

.. method:: double TimeSinceAssigned()

   Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since the task was assigned.

.. method:: double TimeSinceUpdated()

   Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since the task was last updated.

.. method:: void SetCommDevice(string aCommDevice)

   Sets the name of the comm device to be used when transmitting the task assignment.  To be used prior to
   :method:`WsfTaskManager::AssignTask <WsfTaskManager.AssignTask>`

Resource Methods
================

The following methods apply only if the task is a resource (i.e., sensor, weapon, or processor) control task.

.. method:: string ResourceName()

   Returns the name of the sensor, weapon or processor resource. This will be an empty string if the task is not a
   resource control task.

.. method:: bool ResourceIsSensor()
.. method:: bool ResourceIsWeapon()
.. method:: bool ResourceIsJammer()
.. method:: bool ResourceIsProcessor()
.. method:: bool ResourceIsUplink()

   Returns true if the indicated resource is a sensor, weapon, jammer, processor, or uplink, respectively.

.. method:: string ResourceMode()

   Returns the 'mode' for a sensor or jammer task.

.. method:: int ResourceCount()

   Returns the number of resources (rounds) to be used.

.. method:: double ResourceFrequency()

   Returns the center frequency in Hertz for a jamming task.

.. method:: double ResourceBandwidth()

   Returns the jamming bandwidth in Hertz for a jamming task.
