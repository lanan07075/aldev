WsfEW_Effects
-------------

.. class:: WsfEW_Effects

EW Effect Aggregation: :ref:`Electronic_Warfare_Effect_Aggregation`

WsfEW_Effects is the Electronic Warfare (EW) Effects associated with an :class:`WsfEM_Interaction`. The methods of this
scripting class allow for getting the EW Effects for a given interaction.

.. note::

   Use the :method:`WsfEM_Interaction.EW_Effects` script command in the :class:`WsfEM_Interaction`
   scripting class to access the :class:`WsfEW_Effects`.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int Mask()
   
   Returns the current applied EW technique type mask. **TBD in a table at a later date**.

.. method:: bool EA_CoherencyCheck(string aEA_CoherencyType)
   
   Returns 'true' if the Electronic Attack coherency matches the **aEA_CoherencyType** input string.

.. method:: double EffectValue(string aEW_Category, string aEW_ValueType)
.. method:: double EffectValue(string aEW_Category, string aEW_ValueType, string EA_CoherencyType)
   
   Returns the value in *absolute* units for the specified **aValueType** within the specified **aEW_Category**  and
   **aEA_CoherencyType**. If **aEA_CoherencyType** is not specified then the current EA coherency mask calculated during
   the interaction is used to get the values. Please see note below for not specifying an **EA_CoherencyType**.
   
   .. note::

      If the **aEA_CoherencyType** is not specified then the following order is used to return the value for
      the specified **aValueType** with the **aEW_Category** using the calculated EA coherency mask calculated during the
      interaction: 

    1. noise and pulse jamming values multiplied together if both are present
    2. noise jamming value if noise is present and pulse jamming is not (i.e., the first check above fails).
    3. pulse jamming value if the above 2 checks fail.
    4. coherent (CW and Pulse) jamming value is returned if the above 3 checks fail.
    5. If all checks fail 1.0 is returned.
   
Input Values Table
==================
   
   aEA_CoherencyType - A string input that defines the EA coherency type of interest, valid values are listed in the table below.

   * noise: Coherency is of a **noise** type EA technique.
   * noise_and_pulse: Coherency is of a **noise** AND **pulse** type EA technique.
   * pulse: Coherency is of a **pulse** (i.e., pulsed noise) type EA technique.
   * coherent: Coherency is of a **coherent** and/or **coherent_pulse** type EA technique.


   aEW_Category - A string input that defines the EW category type of interest, valid values are listed in the table below.
   
   .. note::

      Invalid input values (strings) will result in a value return of -1.0.

   * error: Error category within the EW Effects, valid types are defined in error table below.
   * jamming: Power/Jamming gain modification category within the EW Effects, valid types are defined in jamming table below.
   * signal: Signal gain modification category within the EW Effects, valid types are defined in signal table below.
   * repeater_data: Repeater data category used for gain modification within the EW Effects, valid types are defined in repeater_data table below.

   aEW_ValueType - A string input that defines the EW value type of interest, valid values are listed in the tables below by aEW_Category.
   
   .. note::

      invalid input values (strings) will result in a value return of -1.0.

   error

   * azimuth: Azimuth error applied to the track measured data.
   * elevation: Elevation error applied to the track measured data.
   * range: Range error applied to the track measured data.
   * velocity: Velocity error applied to the track measured data.
   * bit_error_rate or BER: Bit Error Rate (BER) applied to the communication link data message.


   jamming
   power
      
      * blanking: The blanking factor that was applied.
      * cancellation: The cancellation factor that was applied.
      * modulation_gain: The modulation gain factor that was applied.

   signal
      
      * signal_gain: The signal power gain (multiplier) applied to the receiver's received signal power level.
      * noise_power_gain: The noise power gain (multiplier) applied to the receiver's noise power level.


   repeater_data
      
      * minimum_gain: The minimum gain that the repeater was allowed to use for this EW effect's interaction.
      * gain: The gain that the repeater used for this EW effects interaction.
      * maximum_gain: The maximum gain that the repeater was allowed to use for this EW effect's interaction.
