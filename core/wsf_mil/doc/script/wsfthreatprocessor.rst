.. method:: Array<WsfTrackId> Threats( )
   
   Returns the track Ids of all local tracks that are considered threatening according to the inputs given to the
   :model:`WSF_THREAT_PROCESSOR` such as threat_velocity, threat_angle_spread, and threat_time_to_intercept.

.. method:: WsfTrack NearestThreat()
