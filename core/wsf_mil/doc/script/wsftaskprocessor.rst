WsfTaskProcessor
----------------

.. class:: WsfTaskProcessor inherits WsfTaskManager


:class:`WsfTaskProcessor` encapsulates the ability to query and change the state of a track.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int CountInState(string aStateName)
   
   Return the number of tracks that are in the state indicated by "aStateName'.

.. method:: Array<WsfLocalTrack> TracksInState(string aStateName)
   
   Return the list of tracks that are in the state indicated by "aStateName'.

.. method:: void EnterState(WsfTrackId aTrackId, string aStateName)
   
   Force an immediate transition into state indicated by "aStateName' for the track represented by track ID "aTrackId'.

.. method:: string StateOfTrack(WsfTrackId aTrackId)
   
   Return the state the the track indicated by 'aTrackId' currently resides in.

.. method:: void SetEvaluationInterval(double aTimeInterval)
   
   Dynamically changes the evaluation interval to the value indicated by 'aTimeInterval' for the current task processor.

.. method:: void SetTransitionTime(double aTransitionTime)
   
   Sets the time to required to transition into the next state, if a transition is to occur. This can be used to cause a
   delay to simulate processing or thought time.
