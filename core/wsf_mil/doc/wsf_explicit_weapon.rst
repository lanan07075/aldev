Overview
========

:model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` represents a :command:`weapon` that is modeled as an independent platform when it is fired.

.. block:: WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON

Commands
========

.. command:: launched_platform_type <string-reference>
   
   Specifies the type of platform to be created when a weapon of this type is launched. The specified value must represent
   a valid platform type that must be defined when this object is initialized in the simulation.
   
   **Default:** No default. Must be specified.

.. command:: launch_delta_v <x-velocity> <y-velocity> <z-velocity> <speed-units>
   
   Specifies the vector that represents the additional velocity, relative to the launching platform, provided by the
   launching mechanism.  This value is specified in the entity coordinate system (+X is forward, +Y to the right and +Z
   down) of the launching part (see :ref:`Articulated_Part_Commands`).
   
   .. note::

      If the net speed is less than 1 m/s, then a 10 m/s speed forward will be used if launch_delta_v_ is less than or equal to 1 m/s.
   
   **Default:** 0.0 0.0 0.0 m/s (i.e., the initial velocity relative to the velocity of the launching platform)

.. command:: ignore_launch_platform_velocity <boolean-value>
   
   Specifies that the initial velocity of a launched explicit weapon will ignore the vector component of launch platform
   velocity.  Normally the initial weapon velocity is the vector sum of launch_delta_v_ plus the launching platform
   velocity. 
   
   .. note::

      It is best to set this to true for ship-launched weapons because of a typical guided mover's
      large integration time increment (typically set between 0.1 to 0.5 seconds).
   
   .. note::

      If launched from a moving platform, it is best to set this to true to avoid possible misfires.
   
   **Default:** false

.. command:: require_loft_angle 

.. command:: require_intercept_point 
   
   Indicates that the :command:`launch_computer` must have provided the attribute specified by the command.

.. command:: commander  <commander> [ command_chain <command-chain> ]
   
   Specifies the commander(s) of the launched platform. If **command_chain** is not provided, the default command chain
   will be assumed. **<commander>** may be one of the following values:
   
   * A platform name, indicating the specified platform is the commander.
   * SELF, indicating that the launched platform is its own commander.
   * LAUNCHER, indicating that the launching platform is the commander.
   * LAUNCHER_COMMANDER, indicating the the launching platforms' commander is the commander.
   
   This command can be repeated multiple times to assign multiple commands (on different command chains).
   
   **Default:** The launching platform is designated as the commander of the launched platform for each of the command chains
   in which the launching platform is a member.

.. command:: dis_entity_id_offset <integer-value>
   
   Adds this value onto the value of the platform index and sets the the weapon dis entity id.  This value is used in the
   entity id fields in all DIS PDUs associated with this weapon.  It is a way for the user to have some control of
   assigning weapon ids to weapons prior to launch and/or in a DIS environment.  The the sum of the platform index and the
   value must not exceed 65535.
   
   **Default:** 0

Script Interface
================

:model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` uses the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface`, as well as providing the following:

.. command:: on_create

   .. parsed-literal::
   
      script void on_create(:class:`WsfPlatform` aWeapon, :class:`WsfTrack` aTarget) ... end_script
   
   Defines a script that is called immediately after the weapon platform is created but before it is actually inserted
   into the simulation.  This script is typically used to modify attributes of the weapon platform that must change before
   the weapon is added to the simulation. 'aWeapon' is a reference to the newly created weapon platform and 'aTarget' is a
   reference to the target track object.
   
   .. note::

      The weapon platform has not been initialized yet. It has a name, side, commander's name, launch state, and target track.
      All other data on the platform is undefined.
