Overview
========

:model:`WSF_SCRIPT_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` implements a launch computer that uses the scripting language for determining if an
intercept can occur.

The following example demonstrates how to implement a script-based launch computer. This example is very simple in that
it assumes the target is flying straight-and-level at a constant speed, and that the weapon flies at the defined
average speed. It shows:

* The required method name and signature.
* The predefined script variables.
* How to report the intercept results.

Note that the :method:`WsfLaunchComputer.SetInterceptTime` call is required to report a successful intercept. Failure to
call this method will indicate that an intercept is not possible.

Example
=======

.. parsed-literal::

   launch_computer EX_LAUNCH_COMPUTER WSF_SCRIPT_LAUNCH_COMPUTER

      # This is the required script method name and signature.

      script void compute_intercept(:class:`WsfTrack` aTrack, double aLaunchDelay)

         # If needed the following additional script variables are pre-defined:
         #
         #       WEAPON   references the :class:`WsfWeapon` to which the launch computer is attached.
         #       PLATFORM references the :class:`WsfPlatform` to which the weapon is attached.

         double weaponSpeed = 500.0;         # Assumed weapon speed
         :class:`WsfWaypoint` intercept = WsfWaypoint();
         double tti = PLATFORM.InterceptLocation2D(aTrack, intercept, weaponSpeed, aLaunchDelay);
         if (tti > 0.0)
         {
            :class:`WsfGeoPoint` interceptPoint =
            WsfGeoPoint.Construct(intercept.Latitude(), intercept.Longitude(), aTrack.Altitude());
            SetInterceptPoint(interceptPoint);
            # The next call is the **minimum** requirement for reporting an intercept.
            SetInterceptTime(TIME_NOW + tti);
            SetLaunchTime(TIME_NOW + aLaunchDelay);
            SetTimeOfFlight(tti - aLaunchDelay);
         }
      end_script

   end_launch_computer
