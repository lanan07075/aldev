Overview
========

:model:`WSF_ATA_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` implements a launch computer for an air-to-air missile. (This type is deprecated, in favor
of :model:`WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`.)  The missiles may have various engagement constraints that must be satisfied
prior to launch of the :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON`.

A weapon_tool has been developed to assist with creation of launch computers of this type.  See
:model:`AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR`.

.. block:: WSF_ATA_LAUNCH_COMPUTER

Commands
========

.. command:: intercept_results ... end_intercept_results
   
   This block contains the data that defines the intercept envelope.  It is recommended that this data be generated using
   the LAR generator weapon tool.

      SUBCOMMANDS

      .. command:: number_of_aspect_angle_bins *<number>*

         Specifies the number of azimuth angle bins in the intercept envelope.  The azimuthal coverage will be from 0 to 180
         degrees.  Azimuthal symmetry is assumed.

      .. command:: azimuth_bin_count_end_limit <number> <angle>
         
         Similar to number_of_aspect_angle_bins_ but limits the azimuthal coverage to the specified value.

      .. command:: elevation_bin_count_min_and_max_limits <number> <min-angle> <max-angle>
         
         Specifies the number of elevation angle bins in the intercept envelope between the specified minimum and maximum angles.

      .. command:: range_rate_bin_count_min_and_max_limits <number> <min-range-rate> <max-range-rate>
         
         Specifies the number of range rate (i.e., closing velocity) bins in the intercept envelope between the specified
         minimum and maximum rates.

      .. command:: firing_range_bin_count_and_values <number> <range1> <range2> ... <rangen>
         
         Specifies the number of launch range bins and the corresponding range in the intercept envelope.

      .. command:: time_of_flight_values ... end_time_of_flight_values
         
         The intercept envelope (a series of time-of-flight values) for the above specified (m X n X p X q X r) rectangular
         matrix of engagement parameters. Any time-of-flight given as 0.0 indicates no intercept is possible under these
         conditions.

.. command:: generate_rectangular_results ... end_generate_rectangular_results

This block is used by the offline LAR generator tool to generate the intercept_results_ block.  It is referred to
as "rectangular" because the weapon_tool methodically (i.e., via "brute force") calculates a time-of-flight result for
each group of engagement conditions in a (m X n X p X q X r) rectangular matrix of m aspect angles, n azimuth bins, p
elevation bins, q range-rate bins, and r range bins.  Any 0.0 value of time-of-flight indicates no intercept is
possible; there are likely to be many zero values in the table.

      SUBCOMMANDS

      .. command:: aspect_angle_bin_count <number>
                  azimuth_bin_cint *<number>*
         
         Specifies how many azimuth bins that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: 4

      .. command:: azimuth_limit <angle>
         
         Specifies the maximum azimuth angle that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: 90.0 deg

      .. command:: elevation_bin_count <number>
         
         Specifies the number of elevation bins that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: 4

      .. command:: elevation_lower_limit <angle>
         
         Specifies the minimum elevation angle that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: -45.0 deg

      .. command:: elevation_upper_limit <angle>
         
         Specifies the maximum elevation angle that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: 45.0 deg

      .. command:: range_rate_bin_count number
         
         Specifies the number of range rate bins that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: 4

      .. command:: range_rate_lower_limit <range-rate>
         
         Specifies the minimum range rate that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.

         Default: 4

      .. command:: minimum_ground_range <range>
         
         Specifies the minimum range that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
         
         Default: 0.0

      .. command:: maximum_ground_range <range>
         
         Specifies the maximum range that will be used to generate the intercept envelope.
