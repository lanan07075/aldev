Overview
========

:model:`WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER` is a processor that typically resides on a weapon and provides the guidance for a weapon
whose mover is typically of type :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`. It uses the track provided through
:method:`CurrentTargetTrack <WsfPlatform.CurrentTargetTrack>` to represent the target to be pursued. The mover invokes this
processor to request guidance updates. The processor computes the desired guidance and supplies them back to the mover.

Guidance Programs
+++++++++++++++++

Starting with AFSIM 2.2 an additional form of guidance is provided through the use of 'programs'. Programs several advantages
over the existing guidance methods:

* They don't have any hidden behavior. With the old system you had to explicitly disable things proportional and pursuit guidance
  and gravity bias if you didn't want them. With the new system you don't get them unless you ask for them.
  
* Programs can span phases. You can define a program and use it such that it will retain its state across phase changes.

* Multiple programs can be executed in one phase to get a combined effect.

* The program architecture is extensible. New program types can be easily added. If a new guidance model is needed for a particular
  application it can be compiled and included like any other model.
  
The initial set of programs provided in AFSIM 2.2 were mainly to implement launch-to-orbit capabilities and some advanced ballistic
missile needs. Thus, it will not initially serve all needs.

The use of guidance programs or the legacy guidance is selected by phase. If you use or define a program within a phase then only
programs will be used. If you do not use or define a program within a phase then you will get the legacy behavior. Each phase can
be different - one can use programs and another can use legacy guidance.

Global Commands
===============

.. note::

   The :command:`processor.update_interval` command should NOT be specified for this processor.
   It is called as required from the mover.

.. command:: show_status
   
   Specifies that information should be written to standard output whenever a phase or stage transition occurs.

.. command:: show_diagnostics

   Specifies that diagnostic information from guidance programs should be written to standard output. This is typically used
   when attempting to tune the guidance computer for generating orbital launch computers with :command:`weapon_tools`.

   .. note:: This introduces some extra overhead and should be used only during tuning.

.. command:: show_commands
   
   Specifies that calls from script commands should be written to standard output.

.. command:: show_evaluations
   
   Specifies that phase change rule evaluations should be written to standard output.

.. command:: guide_to_truth <boolean-value>
   
   Specifies if the guidance target should be the location specified in the current target track (false), or should be the
   true location of the platform specified in the current target track (true).
   
   This command exists both here and in the 'phase' block. This form specifies the default for a phase if the command was
   not specified in the phase block.
   
   **Default:** false

.. command:: phase <phase-name> phase-commands end_phase
   
   The 'phase' block is used to define the guidance for the various phases of flight and the rules to transition between
   phases.
   
   The format of a phase block is:
   
   .. parsed-literal::
   
      phase <phase-name>
         ... `phase commands`_ ...
      end_phase
   
   The 'phase' block should be defined for each unique phase required. The first 'phase' block defines the phase to be
   used then the weapon is fired.

.. command:: edit phase <phase-name> phase-commands end_phase
   
   This command is typically used when creating a new guidance computer type by deriving from another guidance computer
   type.
   
   For example:
   
   .. parsed-literal::
   
      processor DEMO_GUIDANCE WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER
         guide_to_truth true
         phase TERMINAL
            ...
         end_phase
      end_processor
     
      processor DEMO_GUIDANCE_MOD DEMO_GUIDANCE
         edit phase TERMINAL
            guide_to_truth false      # Overrides the base class value
         end_phase
      end_processor

.. command:: program <name> <type> ... end_program
 
   Defines a guidance program with the specified <name> using the predefine guidance program <type>
   (See :ref:`Guidance_Program_Types`.) The program can then be selected for use in a phase by
   specifying use_program_ <name>.
   
   **Note:** A program must appear in the input prior to the use_program_ that references the program.
   
   For example:
   
   .. parsed-literal::
   
      program RESET_ATTITUDE :ref:`guidance_program_types.ATTITUDE_PROGRAM`
         reset
         yaw_rate 5 deg/sec
         pitch_rate 5 deg/sec
         roll_rate 5 deg/sec
      end_program
      ...
      phase BEGIN_DESCENT
         use_program RESET_ATTITUDE
         next_phase DESCENT when program RESET_ATTITUDE complete
      end_phase
      ...
      phase DESCENT
         ...
      end_phase

Phase Commands
==============

The subcommands in a phase_ block can be broken in the following broad categories:

   * `General Subcommands`_
   * `Aimpoint Selection Subcommands`_ - specifies how to determine the target point.
   * `Program Selection Subcommands`_ - select or define guidance programs to be executed.
   * `Navigation Subcommands`_ - specifies how to navigate to the target point.
   * `Trajectory Shaping Subcommands`_ specifies how to modify the trajectory while navigating.
   * `Limiting Subcommands`_ - specifies limits on computations.
   * `Phase Changing Subcommands`_ transition to other phases based on a number of conditions.

General Subcommands
+++++++++++++++++++

.. command:: guidance_delay <time-value>
   
   Specifies the elapsed time **since the start** of the phase when guidance commands should start being computed. This is
   useful during lift-off and other phases where pursuit of the target is not desirable.
   
   **Default:** 0 seconds (start computing guidance commands upon entry into the phase)
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetGuidanceDelay`.

.. command:: on_entry ... end_on_entry
             on_exit ... end_on_exit

   These commands define scripts to be executed when entering and exiting the phase.
   
   ::
   
      on_entry
         ... script commands ...
      end_on_entry
   
   ::
   
      on_exit
         ... script commands ...
      end_on_exit
      
.. command:: on_update ...
 
    Define a script to be executed on every phase update.
    
    ::
   
      on_update
         ... script commands ...
      end_on_update
    
    This script is generally only used when:
    
    * The values of guidance commands must be varied during a phase
    * A phase change condition needs to be evaluated that cannot be accomplished with a next_phase_ command.
    
    .. note::
    
       Do not use this indiscriminately as it is executed at every integration time step of the mover. Attempt to keep
       the script as simple as possible

Aimpoint Selection Subcommands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. command:: guidance_target [ predicted_intercept | perception | truth ]
             guide_to_truth <boolean-value>

   Overrides the top-level guide_to_truth_ command for the current phase. This is expanded to include the options:
   
   * predicted_intercept - Guidance computations are based on the predicted intercept location provided by the launch
     computer. No consideration is given to the actual location of the target. This is often used during the initial
     phases when prediction of an intercept point based on CURRENT conditions is unreliable.
   * perception - Guidance computations are made based on the perception of the target as provided by the current target track.
     Because the track may have sensor errors, the weapon may be directed to a location other that where the target is located.
     (This is the same as guide_to_truth_ false).
   * truth - Guidance computations are made based on the actual location of the target.
     (This is the same as guide_to_truth_ true).
   * default - Use value from the global guide_to_truth_ command.

   The **guide_to_truth** form is an older form. See the above for description for the equivalent values.
   
   **Default:** **default** (Use the value of the top-level guide_to_truth_ command.)
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetGuidanceTarget`.

.. command:: aimpoint_altitude_offset <length-value>

   Modify the aimpoint to be above or below the perceived target location. This is typically used to create an air burst.

   **Default:** 0 meters (no altitude offset)

   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetAimpointAltitudeOffset`.

   .. note: This value is not used if following a route of if a commanded_altitude_ is specified.
   
.. command:: aimpoint_azimuth_offset <angle-value> [ left | right | either ]
             aimpoint_range_offset <length-value>
   
   These commands provide a method to produce an aimpoint that is laterally offset from the perceived target location. This is typically used
   to meet some tactical requirement.

   **aimpoint_azimuth_offset** is the desired relative bearing to the target ('angle off the nose') when the ground range to the target
   is equal to the value specified by  **aimpoint_range_offset**. The **left**, **right** and **either** modifiers for **aimpoint_azimuth_offset** indicates where the target should be located with respect to the weapon. **either** will place the offset so as to minimize the
   heading change of the weapon.

   These commands may also be combined with aimpoint_altitude_offset_.

   Following is a brief example of how to use this command::

      phase PHASE_X
         ...
         aimpoint_altitude_offset     10000 m
         aimpoint_azimuth_offset      45 deg either
         aimpoint_range_offset        10 nm
   
         next_phase PHASE_Y when target_azimuth > 45 deg
      end_phase

   In this example the aimpoint will be created such that when the weapon reaches the point, the target will be 10
   nautical miles away at relative bearing of 45 degrees and the weapon will be at an altitude of 10000 m above that of
   the target. The comparison value in next_phase_ command for **target_azimuth** should be same value of the aimpoint_azimuth_offset.
      
   **Default:** No aimpoint offsets.

   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetAimpointAzimuthOffset` and :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetAimpointRangeOffset`.

   .. note::

      If either **aimpoint_azimuth_offset** or **aimpoint_range_offset** is non-zero then both must be non-zero.

   .. note::

      The aimpoint offset will not be applied while following a route.
   
   .. note::

      This is typically only used for static or slowly moving surface targets. It has not been tested for air targets.

.. command:: aimpoint_evaluation_interval <time-value>

   Controls how often a new aimpoint is computed when using aimpoint_azimuth_offset_ and aimpoint_range_offset_. This is a fairly
   time-consuming operation that does not need to be performed on every call to the guidance computer.
   
   **Default:** 5 seconds.

   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetAimpointEvaluationInterval`

.. command:: allow_route_following <boolean-value>
   
   If true, the computer will follow a :command:`route` if it has been provided to the associated :command:`mover`. If the mover
   does not have a route then this command has no effect. Conventional target point selection will resume at the end of the route.
   
   The command 'next_phase_ <phase-name> at_end_of_route' may be used to switch to a different phase when the end of the route
   is encountered.
   
   **Default:** false

   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetAllowRouteFollowing`

Program Selection Subcommands
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Specify the guidance programs that will be used within the phase. One or more programs may be selected or defined and are
called in order of appearance.

Note that the many of the programs have commands that have the same purpose as defined in `Navigation Subcommands`_ and
`Trajectory Shaping Subcommands`_ below. In such cases the command can be defined in either the program definition or
in the phase. If it is defined in the program then it CANNOT be overridden by script commands.

Also note that some of the `Limiting Subcommands`_ are overridden by the programs.

.. command:: use_program <name>

   Specifies that the named program defined in a program_ block outside of the phase_ will be used. It is useful to define a program
   if it is going to be used in multiple phases.
   
.. command:: program <type> end_program

   Defines a program of the specified <type> and uses it for the current phase_.  <type> must be one of the predefined guidance program types (see :ref:`Guidance_Program_Types`.)

Navigation Subcommands
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. command:: proportional_navigation_gain <real-value>
   
   Specifies the gain for proportional navigation. A value of zero indicates proportional navigation will not be performed.
   
   **Default:** 3.0
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetProportionalNavigationGain`.
   
.. command:: proportional_navigation_limit_angle <angle-value>
             aspect_angle_for_pro_nav_switch <angle-value>
   
   Specifies the 3D aspect angle of the target with respect to the weapon at which the navigation method will switch
   between proportional and velocity pursuit. Proportional navigation will be used if the target aspect angle is less than
   or equal to this value, otherwise velocity pursuit will be used.
   
   **Default:** 30.0 degrees
   
   **Script:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetProportionalNavigationLimitAngle`.

.. command:: proportional_navigation_method  [ pure | augmented ]
   
   Specifies whether additional acceleration should be commanded because of current target acceleration.
   
   **Default:** pure (target acceleration ignored)
   
   **Script:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetProportionalNavigationMethod`.

.. command:: velocity_pursuit_gain <real-value>
   
   Specifies the gain for velocity pursuit navigation. A value of zero indicates velocity pursuit navigation will not be
   performed.
   
   **Default:** 10.0
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetVelocityPursuitGain`.

Trajectory Shaping Subcommands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The trajectory shaping subcommands are used to modify the computed navigation commands to shape the trajectory.

.. command:: g_bias <real-value>
   
   Specifies the bias factor used to overcome gravity. This is typically used during mid-course to prevent the trajectory
   from sagging. If zero is specified then gravity bias will not be applied.
   
   **Default:** 1.0
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetGeeBias`.

.. command:: lateral_g_bias <real-value>
   
   Specifies the bias factor used skew the horizontal component of the trajectory in a particular direction. If zero is specified then gravity bias will not be applied.
   
   **Default:** 0.0
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetLateralGeeBias`.

.. command:: commanded_altitude <length-value> [ msl | agl ]
   
   Specifies a commanded altitude. Typically used to climb or dive to a cruise altitude and hold the altitude. The
   altitude reference tag ('**msl**', or 'above mean sea level'; '**agl**', or 'above ground level') may be omitted, in
   which case '**msl**' is assumed.
   
   Specifying an altitude reference of '**agl**' is a crude mechanism for implementing terrain-following. When '**agl**'
   is specified the mover will enforce an additional constraint that it always stays above the ground. However, no
   look-ahead is performed (it only checks the height above the terrain directly under the platform), so it is possible
   that the vehicle may make very abrupt changes if the terrain rises rapidly.
   
   **Default:** No commanded altitude
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedAltitude` and :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedAltitudeAGL`.

.. command:: commanded_azimuth_offset <angle-value>

   Specifies the azimuth angle to the target that should be maintained. The angle is defined to be the angle in the local horizontal
   plane between the weapon velocity vector and the line-of-sight vector from the weapon to the target. (This is consistent with the
   'target_azimuth' conditional tests in the next_phase_ command.) 

   **Default:** No commanded azimuth offset angle.
 
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedAzimuthOffset`

.. command:: commanded_flight_path_angle <angle-value>
             commanded_flight_path_angle from_launch_computer
   
   Specifies a commanded flight path angle. If **from_launch_computer** is specified then the value produced by the launch
   computer will be used (if present).
   
   This is typically used to produce lofted ballistic trajectories.
   
   **Default:** No commanded flight path angle.
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedFlightPathAngle`

.. command:: commanded_mach <real-value>
             commanded_speed <speed-value>
   
   Specifies the commanded speed/mach to be used during this phase. Typically used for cruise.
   
   **Default:** No commanded speed or Mach.
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedSpeed` and :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedMach`.

   .. note::
   
      Not all movers support this capability.
   
   .. note::
   
      Fuel utilization may not be properly modeled when using this command.

.. command:: commanded_throttle <real-value>

   Specifies a throttle factor in the range [0..1] that overrides and throttle specification in the mover.   
   
   This is not typically used as a command. It exists primarily to allow script calls to alter the throttle.
   
   **Default:** No commanded throttle.
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetCommandedThrottle`

Limiting Subcommands
++++++++++++++++++++

.. command:: maximum_commanded_g <acceleration-value>
   
   Specifies the magnitude of the maximum acceleration that can be commanded.
   
   **Default:** 25.0 g
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetMaximumCommandedGees`.

.. command:: maximum_ascent_rate <speed-value>
             maximum_descent_rate <speed-value>
   
   Specifies the maximum rate of ascent or descent to be used to reach the commanded_altitude_.

   .. note::
      A value of 0 specifies no constraint on ascent/descent rate.
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetMaximumAscentRate` and :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetMaximumDescentRate`.

   **Default:** 0, no constraint

.. command:: maximum_pitch_angle <angle-value>
   
   Specifies the absolute value of the maximum flight path angle that may be used to ascend or descend to the
   commanded_altitude_.
   
   **Default:** 70.0 degrees
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetMaximumPitchAngle`

.. command:: pitch_change_gain <real-value>

   Specifies the gain factor for changing the pitch angle when trying to achieve the commanded_altitude_.
   
   **Default:** 1.0
   
   **Script Command:** :method:`WsfGuidanceComputer.SetPitchChangeGain`

Phase Changing Subcommands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. command:: next_phase <phase-name> [if | when] <event>
             next_phase <phase-name> [if | when] <variable> [<operator> <reference-value>]
   
   The **next_phase** command defines a condition under which a phase transition occurs. A phase block may have multiple
   **next_phase** commands to define a number of conditions that might trigger a phase change. The **next_phase** commands
   are evaluated on each guidance update and are evaluated in the order specified.
   
   The first form of the command is used for detecting events.

   end_of_route
      The mover has indicated that the last point in a route has been passed (if the mover was following waypoints).

   boost_complete
      The mover has indicated that it is no longer boosting. This typically means that all thrust-producing stages have been used.
      
   stage_ignition
      The mover has indicated the current stage has ignited.
   
   stage_burnout
      The mover has indicated the current stage has burned-out.

   stage_separation
      The mover has indicated the current stage has separated.

   on_commanded_flight_path_angle
      The flight path angle of the weapon has reached the loft angle commanded by the launch computer (if provided)

   sensor_track_initiated
      The local on-board sensor has established autonomous track on the target.

   program <program-name> complete
      The specified program has specified completion. Not all programs have a condition where they define completion.
      Such programs are continuous and will run until the end of the phase.
   
   The second form of the command is used for detecting when the *<variable>* achieves a certain relationship with the
   *<reference-value>*.
   
   *<reference-value>* can either be a constant value of the form:
   
   ::
   
      *<real-value>* *<units>*
   
   Or a variable value of the form:
   
   ::
   
      /variable *<variable-name>*
      variable *<variable-name>* *<units>*
   
   The last two forms indicate the *<reference-value>* is to be gotten from a **double** script variable. The variable **must**
   be defined in a script_variables block that occurs before the command that references the variable and it **must not** appear
   with a 'phase' block.
   
   If the variable is a dimensional quantity then the value of the variable must be in the proper units:
   
      * Standard WSF units if '/variable' is specified. The standard units are indicated in the 'Description' column below.
      * In the units specified *<units>* if 'variable' is specified.
      
   When using the variable form, *<variable-name>* must be the name of an **double** script variable and *<units>*
   represents the units of the data stored in the variable. The variable must be defined within a script_variables block
   in the computer that appears before the reference.
   
   Valid *<operators>* are **<;**, **<;=**, **==**, **!=**, **>;=**, or **>;**. Valid *<variables>* are:
   
   +--------------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | **Variable**             | **Ref-Variable-Type** | Description                                                    |
   +==========================+=======================+================================================================+

   Examples when using a script variable for a reference-value::
   
    # In this form the value of TARGET_ALTITUDE should be in meters.
    next_phase PHASE2 when altitude > /variable TARGET_ALTITUDE
    # In this form the value of TARGET_ALTITUDE should be in kilometers (km).
    next_phase PHASE2 when altitude > variable TARGET_ALTITUDE km
    
   The script variable TARGET_ALTITUDE should have been defined in a 'script_variables' block and assigned a value in one of
   the script blocks exposed by this processor.
