Overview
========

This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_protect` technique block as one
of the many available effects for a given technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be
specified in the effect block for this effect type.

.. block:: WSF_AGILITY_EFFECT

Commands
========

.. command:: debug
   
   Set debug mode for this effect.

.. command:: agility_type  <agility-type> ... end_agility_type
   
   Input block to provide the agility-type of this effect and associated input commands for this agility-type. The
   specified agility-type is applied when a comm system or radar sensor perceives jamming. For this effect to properly
   function a radar sensor's :command:`jamming_perception_threshold <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_threshold>` and
   :command:`jamming_perception_timeout <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_timeout>` or a comm's
   :command:`jamming_perception_threshold <comm.jamming_perception_threshold>` and
   :command:`jamming_perception_timeout <comm.jamming_perception_timeout>` should be properly defined.
   
   **<agility-type>**
      Specifies the agility type to be used. Available agility types are as follows:

      **frequency_changing**
         Provides for changing to different alternate frequencies within the radar sensor's
         :command:`sensor.mode_select_delay` or comm's
         :command:`comm.frequency_select_delay` constraint.

         .. note::
      
            If this effect is an :command:`electronic_protect` on a :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`
            type, then the sensor will be considered frequency agile (pulse-to-pulse) iff this effect is defined as a
            frequency_changing AND :command:`alternate frequencies <_.transmitter.frequency>` are defined on the :command:`_.transmitter` AND
            :command:`jamming perception thresholds <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_timeout>` are set.

      **mode_changing**
         Provides for changing to different radar modes within the
         :command:`mode_select_delay <sensor.mode_select_delay>` constraint.

            ...
            
         **<mode-name-n>** - Specifies the mode name that will be applied in the order of the preceding values from [1,N].
