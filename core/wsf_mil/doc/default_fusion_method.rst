Default Fusion Method
---------------------

Overview
========

There are a standard set of rules and algorithms that WSF uses in most situations to fuse track and measurement
information.  Informally these constitute the "default" WSF fusion method.  Here we describe these rules and
algorithms in more detail.

Combinatorial Rules

.. centered:: Fusion Products (F), based on Local track data (L) and Non-Local track data (NL) ! Range
