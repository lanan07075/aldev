Data Structure Conventions
--------------------------

Naming Conventions
==================

The established AFSIM naming conventions ensure consistency and enable users to recognize whether a name is a file or platform/sensor/pattern.

.. centered:: Table 1. Naming Conventions

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Pattern
     - Convention
     - Example

   * - Names
     - Use hyphens where hyphens are used and underscores to replace spaces or other special characters
     - **F18 radar** becomes **f-18_radar**

   * - File Name
     - Lowercase letters
     - **generic_f-18_radar.txt**

   * - Platform/Sensor
     - Capitalize & replace /, space, or dash with underscore
     - **Tin Shield** -> **TIN_SHIELD**

   * - Name of platform, sensor, ... defined in file
     - Same as file name (without the suffix) in ALL UPPERCASE
     - file **generic_f-18_radar.txt** defines **GENERIC_F-18_RADAR**

   * - Name of components of a system (e.g., antenna patterns)
     - Start with the name of the system
     - component **radar antenna** becomes **GENERIC_F-18_RADAR_ANTENNA**

   * - Radar mode names
     - All uppercase
     - mode **ACQUIRE**


Directory Structure
===================

The file repository directory tree (Table 2) illustrates the directory structure used for AFSIM input files.

The input files are organized into subdirectories under **base_types** and **<other>_types** subdirectories.  Drilling down, these are further separated to provide ***patterns***, ***platforms***, ***sensors***, ***signatures***, and ***weapons***.

The user project directories (e.g., **iads_demo** that is delivered with AFSIM) are divided into its own directory structure that mimic those of the input file example subdirectories.  These directories contain files that 'override' the base input files.  This approach allows the user to have a stable, preserved base case with known behavior that can be modified in a straightforward, consistent manner.

.. note::
   For example, if a user wants to modify the behavior of a specific weapon, a copy of the base weapon from the **base_types/weapons** subdirectory can be made to the local project **scenario/weapons** directory. Changes then can be made to the local weapon.  Likewise, additional models can be copied to the project subdirectories, which will override the models in base_types.

.. note::
   The directory structure delivered with AFSIM is not required in order for AFSIM to execute. The convention was established over a period of time in order to have a consistent structure of the the data input files.
