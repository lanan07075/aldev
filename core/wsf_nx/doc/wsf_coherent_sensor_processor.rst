Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COHERENT_SENSOR_PROCESSOR` provides for Coherent Sensor capabilities that include the ability to process multiple sensor :class:`WsfEM_Interaction` results (i.e. non-local results) into a single interaction result (local result) for detection and track reporting. This processor will based upon the result_processing_type_ calculate a local result from a non-local result and use fusion to calculate the local result location (i.e. measurement) from the non-local results.

.. note::
   If an :command:`processor.update_interval` is specified then the sensor or target results will be queued until the next update interval and batch processed. If an :command:`processor.update_interval` is not specified then the sensor or target results will be processed as each target is updated by each sensor.

The processor is typically used in the following construct:

.. parsed-literal::

   platform_type ...
      sensor sensor-1 :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`
         ...
         # Forward the tracks to 'track_proc'
         processor track_proc
      end_sensor

      sensor sensor-2 :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`
         ...
         # Forward the tracks to 'track_proc'
         processor track_proc
      end_sensor

      processor cs_proc :model:`WSF_COHERENT_SENSOR_PROCESSOR`
         ...
         # Forward the extracted 'tracks' to 'track_proc'
         processor track_proc

         # Connect to sensors to collect 'interaction' data for processing
         sensors
            sensor sensor-1
            sensor sensor-2
         end_sensors
      end_processor

      processor track_proc :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`
         ...
         # Implicitly takes the tracks from 'cs_proc' and updates the track_manager

Commands
========

.. command:: sensors ... end_sensors
   :block:

   .. parsed-literal::

    sensors
       sensor_ <sensor-name>
       platform_sensor_ <platform-name> <sensor-name>
    end_sensors

   .. command:: sensor <sensor-name>

      Specifies the name of the sensor, *<sensor-name>*, on the same platform as the processor.

   .. command:: platform_sensor <platform-name> <sensor-name>

      Specifies the name of the sensor, *<sensor-name>*, on an external platform with name *<platform-name>*.

.. block:: WSF_COHERENT_SENSOR_PROCESSOR

.. command:: detection_threshold <dbratio-value>

   An alternative method of defining the receiver's detection threshold.  The value can be entered here for readability of
   the input file.

   Default: 3.0 dB

.. command:: use_target_result <boolean-value>

   Specifies if 'true' that the target result from each sensor should be used. If 'false' use each of the sensor results, a culmination of each mode and beam dependent upon sensor capabilities.

   Default: false

.. command:: coast_time <time-value>

   Specifies the maximum amount of time that may elapse between updates before a track is dropped.

.. command:: result_processing_type [ SNR_BASED | RSS_BASED ]

   Specifies the results processing type to be used to calculate the resulting Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) from the non-local sensor or target results to the local result to be used in track formation.

   .. note::
      Note that fusion will take place with any type.

* **SNR_BASED** - Use the best non-local result for forming the local result based on SNR, the best non-local result's SNR and other data will replace the local result.

* **RSS_BASED** - Use the Root of the Sums Squared (RSS) of the signal power coupled with the RMS of noise power for each of the non-local results with valid signal and noise power measurements to calculate the local results signal, noise and SNR.

   .. math::
      SNR_{\mathrm{RSS}} = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_{signal\_i}^2}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_{noise\_i}^2/N}}

 Default: SNR_BASED

.. command:: fusion_method [ replacement | weighted_average | MTT(Multi-Target Tracker) mtt ]

   Specifies the fusion algorithms used by the results processing.

   A fusion algorithm combines information about a single entity from two or more sources into a coherent information set,
   e.g. a measurement or :command:`track`.

* **replacement**- Correlated measurements are fused according to a standard set of algorithms.  Local measurement positions are replaced by nonlocal measurement positions.
* **weighted_average**- Correlated measurements are fused according to a standard set of algorithms.  Local measurement positions are combined with nonlocal measurement positions using the covariance matrices of the local and nonlocal measurement.

   .. note::
      If there is no covariance matrix associated with a nonlocal track, the track manager will attempt to use a measurement covariance matrix, generated from the track's measurement errors in range, elevation, and bearing.

* **mtt** - Correlated measurements and tracks are fused using the Multiple Target Tracker (MTT).  If this method is selected, the correlation_method must also be **mtt**.

   Default: replacement

.. command:: message_length <data-size-value>

   Specify the logical length assigned to the track messages that are created from the image.

   Default: 0 (use the value derived from the :command:`message_table` )

.. command:: message_priority <integer-priority>

   Specify the priority assigned to the track messages that are created from the image.

   Default: 0 (use the value derived from the :command:`message_table` )

Script Interface
================

The following methods extend the :class:`WsfProcessor` script class by adding the following methods to it:

.. method:: AddSensor(string aSensorName)
.. method:: AddSensor(string aPlatformName, string aSensorName)

   Adds the sensor by name to the list of sensor on the :model:`WSF_COHERENT_SENSOR_PROCESSOR`. If aPlatformName is omitted the sensor is assumed to be on the same platform as the processor.

.. method:: RemoveSensor(string aSensorName)
.. method:: RemoveSensor(string aPlatformName, string aSensorName)

   Removes the sensor by name from the list of sensor on the :model:`WSF_COHERENT_SENSOR_PROCESSOR`. If aPlatformName is omitted the sensor is assumed to be on the same platform as the processor.
