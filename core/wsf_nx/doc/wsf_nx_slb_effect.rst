Overview
========

This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_protect` or
:command:`electronic_attack` technique block as one of the many available effects for a given
technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be specified in the effect block for this
effect type.

The Non-Exportable version extends the target blanking effects of the baseline :model:`WSF_SLB_EFFECT` to include an
algorithmic calculation effect based on the number of range cells blanked for each jamming pulse detected.

.. block:: WSF_NX_SLB_EFFECT

Commands
========

.. command:: target_blanking_effect  <target-blanking-type> ... end_target_blanking_effect 
   
   Input block to provide the saturation effect and its associated input commands. See also the base
   :command:`target blanking effect <WSF_SLB_EFFECT.target_blanking_effect>` for more types.
   
   **<target-blanking-type>**
      Specifies the target blanking type to be used. Available target blanking effects are as follows:

      * All of the base :command:`target blanking effects <WSF_SLB_EFFECT.target_blanking_effect>` plus:
      * **cell_blanking_probability_effect** - Probability is calculated using the cumulative probability of blanking N
        cells as specified in 'number_of_cells_blanked' for the system. The equation is as follows:

        :math:`P_{BlankingTarget} = \sum_{n=1}^{number\_cells\_blanked} jamming\_duty\_cycle * (1 - P_{BlankingTarget}(n-1))`
   
        **number_cells_blanked <integer-value>**
           Specifies the number of consecutive range/velocity cells from [1, N], that are blanked for each jamming pulse
           that triggers blanking.
   
           Default: 1
