   Reference Material: `Client to Host Commands`_ for the RELEASE_STORE_ ASCII command

Overview
========

The :doc:`mission` application can function as a weapon server (host) or as a client that requests weapon fires from an
external weapon server.  If using :doc:`mission` in either of these ways then please use the
:command:`realtime` simulation command to run it as a real time application.  If "debug"
is specified, the weapon server client/host will print the sent/received weapon commands to the standard output.  It
will also print how it successfully processed or failed to process the command.

Commands
========

.. command:: port <port>

   This is the only command required to set up the weapon server as a host that listens for "RELEASE_STORE" commands,
   fires, and manages weapon fly-outs.  The weapon server will listen for connections on the given port, and a
   theoretically infinite number of clients can connect and request weapon fires.  It is important to note that the weapon
   server will only be able to handle requests for weapon types that it knows about, so any weapon types referenced in the
   received RELEASE_STORE commands should already be defined in the WSF input files that :doc:`mission` loads.

.. command:: host <host-name>

   TBD

.. command:: outgoing_weapon_server <host> <port>

   If this command is used then :doc:`mission` will act as regular, but will send off "RELEASE_STORE" commands to an external weapon
   server specified by the given host and port.  It will only send off such fire requests for weapon types that are
   specified with the "outgoing_weapon_type" command.  See below.

.. command:: outgoing_weapon_type <weapon type>

   This command is only relevant for :doc:`mission` acting as a weapon server client; it instructs :doc:`mission` on which weapon types should
   be hosted externally by another weapon server.

.. command:: rpi_multiplier <rpi-multiplier-value>

   TBD

.. command:: tn_to_disid_mapping ... end_tn_to_disid_mapping
   :block:

   .. parsed-literal::
    tn_to_disid_mapping_
       tn_to_disid_ ...
    end_tn_to_disid_mapping

   .. command:: tn_to_disid <track_number> <disid>

      The 'tn_to_disid_mapping' block allows an external platform acting as a weapon controller (linker)
      to be set as a weapon's commander upon launch.  Track numbers for external platforms do not get stored internally.
      This approach allows the user to map a track number (decimal value) to a DisEntityId of an external platform using
      the keyword 'tn_to_disid'.

.. block:: wsf_weapon_server
.. command:: weapon_lar_mapping ... end_weapon_lar_mapping
   :block:

   .. parsed-literal::
    weapon_lar_mapping_
       enum_to_type_ ...
    end_weapon_lar_mapping

   The 'enum_to_type' block allows the external application to map a user defined weapon enumeration
   (integer) to a WSF weapon system type name. When a request for LAR data is made via a DisSetData PDU
   data is received, the weapon enumeration field is mapped to a weapon.  If the WSF weapon has valid
   launch computer, data is retrieved and sent back in a DisData PDU.

   .. command:: enum_to_type  <their-weapon-enum> <our-weapon-name>

      TBD

   .. command:: weapon_name_mapping  <their-weapon-enum> <our-weapon-name>

      The 'weapon_name_mapping' block allows the external application to map a user defined weapon name to
      WSF weapon system type name, eliminating the need to be aware of AFSIM types or to easily switch
      weapon types with no affect on the user's simulation.

Client to Host Commands
=======================

This section is included only as reference for other simulations; a :doc:`mission` weapon server client already sends this
command and a :doc:`mission` weapon server (host) already receives & processes this command.

The **release_store** command is the only recognized command at this time.  It follows the format of most ASCII interface
commands: "<command> [key=value]+".  This is to say that the command is simply an ascii string with key value pairs
specified after the command name, all entries separated by a space.  Some parameters are required, others are optional.
The parameter key names are not case sensitive but happen to be shown as uppercase in this guide.

.. block:: wsf_weapon_server
.. command:: release_store ...
   :block:

   .. parsed-literal::
    release_store
       [disid_ ... | nameid_ ...]
       [target_disid_ ... | target_nameid ... | lat ... lon ... alt ...]
       wpn_type_ ...
       lch_type_ ...
       ctrl_track_num
       wpn_tail_number_ ...
       usetailnuminpdus_ ...

   The only required parameters are at least one entry from each of the first three parameter sets: shooter (e.g., disid_), weapon type (wpn_type_), target (e.g., target_disid_).  If the weapon is to have a working J11 interface, then the
   ctrl_track_num_ and wpn_tail_number_ parameters are required, as they specify the J11 track numbers of the two interfacing J11 platforms.


   .. command:: disid <dis-entity-id>
   .. command:: nameid <platform name>

      [Required] (one of these parameters are required in the command string).  They specify the identity of the shooter: the
      dis entity id or the WSF platform name.  If both are sent, the last to be specified in the command will be used.

   .. command:: target_disid <dis-entity-id>
   .. command:: target_nameid <platform name>
   .. command:: lat <latitude>
   .. command:: lon <longitude>
   .. command:: alt <altitude> [Optional] **Default:** 0

      [Optional] Required (one of these parameters are required in the command string). These parameters specify the identity of the
      target: the dis entity id, the WSF platform name, or its geodetic location.  lat_ & lon_ must be given together if at
      all.  It is acceptable to send more than one of these parameters, the weapon server will search for the target in this
      order: dis id, name, then location.

   .. command:: wpn_type <weapon-name>

      [Required] It specifies the name of the WSF weapon type.

   .. command:: lch_type [0 | 1]

      [Optional]  Specifies the domain of the target. 0 = air, 1 = ground.  This parameter is not useful or relevant at this
      time.

   .. command:: ctrl_track_num <controller-j11-track-number>

      [Optional]  Only required if the weapon is to have a working J11 interface.  Specifies the J11 controller (shooter)
      track number.

   .. command:: wpn_tail_number <weapon-j11-track number>

      [Optional]  Only required if the weapon is to have a working J11 interface.  Specifies the J11 weapon track number.

   .. command:: usetailnuminpdus [0 | 1]

      [Optional]  Default is zero.  Specifies that the weapon j11 track number should be used (if possible) as the dis entity
      id as well.  Even if this parameter is set to 1, the weapon server will still only give a best effort to accommodate,
      as other clients could already have weapons with the given dis entity id.

   Example commands::

    release_store disid=1:1:43 wpn_type=aim-9x target_disid=1:1:56
    release_store nameid=blue_striker wpn_type=aim-120 target_disid=1:1:56
    release_store disid=1:1:43 wpn_type=aim-9x target_nameid=red_flanker
    release_store disid=1:1:43 wpn_type=aim-9x target_disid=1:1:56 lat=38.63 lon=-90.2 lch_type=1 ctrl_track_num=13 wpn_tail_number=27 usetailnuminpdus=0
