Overview
========

:model:`WSF_WEAPON_SERVER_PROCESSOR` implements a processor interface to an external weapon server. It is responsible for
handling the outgoing weapon transfer to the appropriate weapon server over a specified network connection.

Background Information:

The id for a weapon is to be unique. Before the weapon allocation stage and during setup, the id will be referred to as
the store id. After the weapon has actually been allocated, the id for the weapon will be referred to as weapon id. The
store id is sent into the weapon server processor. The weapon server processor may or may not change the store id. That
would depend on whether or not the dis_entity_id_offset value is set in the :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` block for that
particular weapon_system_type.

.. parsed-literal::

    weapon USER_WEAPON_TYPE WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON
        .
        .
        .
       :command:`dis_entity_id_offset <WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON.dis_entity_id_offset>` 5000
    end_weapon

The weapon server processor in this case adds the store id to the dis_entity_id_offset (if not supplied then the
dis_entity_id_offset is 0) to form the weapon id. The weapon id will be considered the datalink or ju number for the
weapon. This value used also in the weapon's DisEntityState entity id field, and is set accordingly in the SetData
PDUs, which is passed to the DREAMS weapon server. Upon allocation of the weapon, the SetData PDU is sent to the DREAMS
Weapon Server Application. If the DREAMS weapon server validates the Allocation Set Data PDU, it sends back a
responding Data PDU with the allocation field set to 1 indicating the weapon is allocated, then the weapon goes to an
ALLOCATE (1) state, after which the weapon server processor will send umbilical data. If that data is acknowledged by
the Weapon Server Application, then the process is complete and the weapon goes to the READY (4) state. The weapon can
ONLY be launched when it is in the READY state, else the Fire command is not functional.

If the process was successful, and the 'Fire' command was executed using the weapon id parameter, the DisFire PDU
issued by the WSF application will have the weapon id inserted into the DisFire Pdu entity id field. If the fire
command is executed without the weapon id parameter, the DisFire PDU is issued by WSF using the WSF id method to id
the missile. Most likely the id that was set up during the allocation sequence will not match and there may be problems
with the launch sequence.

.. comment TODO
   The weapon id value can be retrieved by using one of the following **WsfWeaponServerProcessor** functions:
    * :method:`FindWeaponIdByEntry() <WsfWeaponServerProcessor.FindWeaponIdByEntry>`
    * :method:`FindAllocatedWeaponIdByTrack() <WsfWeaponServerProcessor.FindAllocatedWeaponIdByTrack>`
    * :method:`FindAllocatedWeaponIdByStoreId() <WsfWeaponServerProcessor.FindAllocatedWeaponIdByStoreId>`
    * :method:`FindAllocatedWeaponStoreIdByTrack() <WsfWeaponServerProcessor.FindAllocatedWeaponStoreIdByTrack>`

The weapon can be allocated using the following **WsfWeapon** script command:
:method:`AllocateTheWeapon() <WsfWeapon.AllocateTheWeapon>`

The weapon State must be evaluated prior to launch and must be in the READY state (4) to be fired.  A return
state of 1 indicates the weapon was allocated.  A return state of (3) indicates the weapon was never allocated.  The
user can check to see if the DIS Entity Type for the outgoing **weapon_system_type** matches.

.. comment
   for example,  what was
   defined in the **name** block in the :ref:`DREAMS.Munitions_Definition` xml file if connected to that weapon server.

The weapon can be fired by using the **WsfWeapon** :method:`Fire <WsfWeapon.Fire>` script command.

Initially, the store_id value can be set using the **WsfWeaponServerProcessor** function:
SetStoreIdTrackPairing_()

.. block:: WSF_WEAPON_SERVER_PROCESSOR

Commands
========

.. command:: wpn_server_type [ DREAMS | WSF | VENDOR_R ]
   
   Acceptable weapon server choices are DREAMS, WSF and VENDOR_R.

   .. comment
      As of 6/2010, DREAMS is the only weapon server
      integrated with WSF, thus DREAMS must be selected.

.. command:: wpn_server_site <positive-integer>
   
   Unsigned 16-bit integer value that matches weapon server site.
   
   .. comment
      If DREAMS is the weapon server of choice it will match
      the site value defined in the munition_repeater block of the :ref:`DREAMS` xml input file.

.. command:: wpn_server_application <positive-integer>
   
   Unsigned 16-bit integer value that matches weapon server application.

   .. comment
      If DREAMS is the weapon server of choice it will
      match the application value defined in the munition_repeater block of the :ref:`DREAMS` xml input file.

.. command:: wpn_server_entity <positive-integer>
   
   Unsigned 16-bit integer value that matches weapon server entity.

   .. comment
      If DREAMS is the weapon server of choice it will
      match the entityvalue defined in the munition_repeater block of the :ref:`DREAMS` xml input file.

.. command:: ack_time_tolerance <time-value>
   
   Time allowed before the Set Data PDU to allocate the weapon is resent to the weapon server on receipt of a NACK or no
   reply.

   Default (1.0 second)

.. command:: reallocate_on_NACK <boolean-value>
   
   Keep resending even if weapon server sends a NACK signal back for a weapon.  If this flag is set to false, will only
   try to send once, may assume the data is bad going to the weapon server.

   Default (true)

.. command:: debug <boolean-value>
   
   Allows some debug statements to be written to console.

   Default (false)

The DIS Interface File Inputs for the DREAMS Weapon Server
==========================================================

The dis_interface block would be set up as usual with the site and application fields matching what is in the platform
block in the xml input file shown below::

  wsrc_userName.xml input file

  .
  .
  .

  <platform>
   <entity-id>
   <site>79</site>
   <appv2000</app>
    .
    .

   </entity-id>
   </platform>

  <munition-type-defn>
   <!-- Assign a unique identifier to the munition type  -->
    <name>JDRADM_POD</name>

  end of wsrc_userName.xml file.

        .

    This is the critical line that does the weapon transfer out and does the fire PDU and drops the weapon on the WSF
    side. Add this line for all weapon_system_types that are going to be controlled by the weapon server.

WSF Input File Changes for the Weapon Server Interface
======================================================

The spatial_domain for the target MUST be specified for each DREAMS weapon target in order to fill the
air-to-ground or air-to-air field the DREAMS weapon server is expecting.
::Add spatial_domain <;air | land>; appropriately for the platform type.

Each missile type will have its own range and this gets set by using the input dis_entity_id_offset on the
WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON block.
