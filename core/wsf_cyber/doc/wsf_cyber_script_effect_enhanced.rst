Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_SCRIPT_EFFECT_ENHANCED` is a :command:`cyber_effect` that can be defined using the scripting language. This effect is equivalent in functionality with
:model:`WSF_CYBER_SCRIPT_EFFECT` except that it supports the usage of user supplied
parameters in the script context provided during the attack call. As a result, the signature
of the script method overloads for this effect have been modified to provide these additional
parameters.

.. note:: The functionality of this script effect is expected to replace the standard script effect in AFSIM 3.0.

.. note:: This effect does NOT require user supplied data during a CyberAttack initiation call. However, this type supports the usage of such data if provided.

Commands
========

.. command:: platform_type <type> ... end_platform_type

   Define the effect scripts for a platform type.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: platform <name> ... end_platform

   Define the effect scripts for a specific platform.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: default ... end_default

   Define the effect scripts for any victim that is not specified by platform_ or platform_type_.
   This command is only valid once, and multiple instances of this block will only use the last declared
   instance of this block.

Enhanced Effect Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two scripts must be defined to implement an effect:

.. command:: attack
   
   .. parsed-literal::
   
      script void Attack(:class:`WsfCyberEngagement` aEngagement, :class:`WsfCyberAttackParameters` aParameters)
      end_script
   
   The 'Attack' script is invoked when the attack has been determined that it will occur. The method should
   take the necessary actions to cause whatever is needed to implement the effect.

.. command:: restore
   
   .. parsed-literal::

      script void Restore(:class:`WsfCyberEngagement` aEngagement, :class:`WsfCyberAttackParameters` aParameters)
      end_script

   The 'Restore' script is invoked when it has been determined that the victim has recovered from the attack.
   The method should take the necessary actions to rescind whatever actions were taken by the Attack_ script
   (essentially restoring the platform to the state that existed prior to the attack).

User supplied parameters passed during the attack instantiation are available for usage in the context
of these script method overloads.
