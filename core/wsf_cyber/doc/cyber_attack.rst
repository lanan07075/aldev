<type>
   The name of the cyber_attack type being defined.
   
<base_type>
   The name of an existing cyber_attack type or WSF_CYBER_EFFECT, whose definition will be used as the initial
   definition of the new type.

Overview
========

A cyber_attack_ object defines the types of effects that affect the victim of the attack and defines default
responses on the victim should they not have a defined response in their :command:`cyber_protect` object.

Commands
========

.. command::  effect <effect_type>
   
   A :doc:`cyber_effect <predefined_cyber_effect_types>` type that models the effect of the attack on the victim. This command may be
   repeated to specify multiple effects. If multiple effects are associated with this attack, the effects will resolve in 
   the order in which they are listed.
    
   **Default** None. At least one effect must be provided.
   
   .. warning:: Specific effect types may require user input at the time an attack is initiated, via the :ref:`CyberAttack <wsfplatform.cyber_methods>`
                method call, as noted in each of effects documentation available :ref:`here <Predefined_Cyber_Effect_Types>`.
                The user is restricted to a single variable input via these calls. Multiple effects
                with this requirement will share the same variable. Multiple effects with different variable types on a single attack
                are currently not supported at this time, and can be placed on a separate attack type definition as a current workaround.

.. command:: duration <time-value>

   A duration will specify how long the :command:`cyber_attack.effect` lasts. When duration is not set but there exists a :command:`cyber_protect` block associated with the cyber_attack effect then duration will be the summation of the attack_detection_delay_time and attack_recovery_delay_time. 

   **Default** 0 seconds
   
   .. note:: If :command:`cyber_attack.duration` < :command:`cyber_protect.attack_detection_delay_time` then the victim will not be able to draw for cyber immunity to the attack. 

.. command:: scan_delay_time <random-time-value>

   This specifies the amount of time it takes to perform a scan. This is the amount of time between the call
   to :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberScan` and when :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberScanStatus` returns a non-negative value.
   Any call to :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberScanStatus` that occurs before this time elapses will return a negative value,
   indicating the scan is in progress.
   
   **Default** 0 secs
   
.. command:: delivery_delay_time <random-time-value>

   This specifies the amount of time it would take to deliver an exploit. This is the amount of time between the call
   to :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberAttack` and when :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberAttackStatus` returns a non-negative value.
   Any call to :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberAttackStatus` that occurs before this time elapses will return a negative value,
   indicating the delivery is in progress.
   
   **Default** 0 secs

Probability Threshold Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands specify the default probability threshold to be used if the corresponding
value is not provided in the :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.

.. command:: probability_of_scan_detection [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_scan_detection` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 0
   
.. command:: probability_of_scan_attribution [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_scan_attribution` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 0
   
.. command:: probability_of_attack_success [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_attack_success` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 1

.. command:: probability_of_status_report [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_status_report` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 1

.. command:: probability_of_attack_detection [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_attack_detection` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 0

.. command:: probability_of_attack_attribution [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_attack_attribution` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 0
   
.. command:: probability_of_future_immunity [ 0 .. 1 ]

   This specifies the default value for :command:`cyber_protect.probability_of_future_immunity` of a corresponding
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` in :command:`cyber_protect`.
   
   **Default** 0

Random Draw Frequency Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following commands define how often uniform random draws are performed. Each categorical use of random numbers
within an attack type is controlled by a separate command. 

.. _draw_frequency.:

In each of the following commands *<draw_frequency>* can have the following values:

* **always** - A new random value is drawn for each evaluation.

* **once_per_simulation** - A random value is drawn for the first evaluation in the simulation and used for all
  subsequent evaluations.

* **once_per_target** - A random value is drawn for the first evaluation involving a specific target and is used for
  all subsequent evaluations involving the same target.

* **interval_per_simulation <random-time-value>** - A random value is drawn if the simulation time since the last
  draw exceeds the threshold.

* **interval_per_target <random-time-value>** A random value is draw if the simulation time since the last draw
  INVOLVING THE SAME TARGET exceeds the threshold.

.. command:: scan_detection_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if a scan is detected.
   
   **Default** **always**

.. command:: scan_attribution_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if a scan is attributed.
   
   **Default** **always**
   

.. command:: attack_success_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if an attack is successful.
   
   **Default** **always**
   
.. command:: status_report_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if a status report is to be made.
   
   **Default** **always**
   
.. command:: attack_detection_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if an attack is detectable by the victim.
   
   **Default** **always**

.. command:: attack_attribution_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if an attack is attributed by the victim.
   
   **Default** **always**
   

.. command:: future_immunity_draw_frequency <draw_frequency_>

   The frequency of random draws for determining if the victim will be immune to future attacks of the same type.
   
   **Default** **always**
