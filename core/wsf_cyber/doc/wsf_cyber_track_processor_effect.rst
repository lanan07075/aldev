Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_TRACK_PROCESSOR_EFFECT` is a cyber_effect that allows user customized behavior
to be injected on the victim when the victim processes tracks via a :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`.

This effect is defined to affect any matching platform(s) or platform type(s) matching the user specified
target_platform input parameters, along with any track processors matching the user supplied
target_processor instance name or type. Any and all track processors matching the criteria on the
victim platform will be affected. This effect will target the track manager specified by the
track processor, regardless if it is the master track manager, or local to the processor.

Multiple effects of this type acting at the same time on the same victim are processed in the order in which the effects were applied.
This includes multiple effects of this type being used in a single cyber attack definition, in which the user should
order the named effect in the desired order of precedence for the desired behavior.

In all aspects except the above additional input for specifying the track processor, this effect is
the same in terms of input as the :model:`WSF_CYBER_TRACK_MANAGER_EFFECT`, of which this effect derives from.

.. note:: This effect does NOT require user supplied data during a :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberAttack` initiation call.

Commands
========

.. command:: target_processor <processor-name>
.. command:: target_processor <processor-type>

   Specifies either the explicit processor name or processor type that this effect is valid against.
   
.. command:: remove_target_processor <processor-name>
.. command:: remove_target_processor <processor-type>

   Useful for a derived effect type, these commands remove an explicit processor name or processor type that this effect is valid against.
