<type>
   The name of the cyber_protect type being defined.
   
<base_type>
   The name of an existing cyber_protect type or WSF_CYBER_PROTECT, whose definition will be used as the initial
   definition of the new type.

Instantiation on a platform type:

Adding cyber_protect_ to a platform:

       add cyber_protect <type>
         ...
       end_cyber_protect

Editing a cyber_protect_ object on a platform:

.. parsed-literal:

    platform <name> <type>   # or edit platform <name>
       edit cyber_protect

       end_cyber_protect
    end_platform

Overview
========

The cyber_protect_ object defines a platforms response to cyber attacks, which includes the ability to block,
detect and recover from an attack. Every active platform active in a simulation will have either an explicitly
or implicitly define cyber_protect_ object.

The object contains zero or more attack_response_ blocks, each of which defines the response to a particular
type of attack as defined by :command:`cyber_attack`. When an attack is attempted the response will be selected
according to the following algorithm:

1. Attempt to locate the :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` with the name '<T>'.
2. If step 1 fails, for each :command:`cyber_attack` type that '<T>' inherits from, attempt to locate the
   :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` whose name matches the inherited type. 
3. If steps 1 and 2 fail attempt to locate the :command:`cyber_protect.attack_response` entry named 'default'.
4. If steps 1, 2 and 3 fail use an internal response dynamically created from the default
   default response values in the :command:`cyber_attack` type '<T>'.
     
For more information about the implementation of a cyber attack please see :ref:`cyber_overview`.

Commands
========

.. command:: attack_response [ <attack_type> | default ] ... end_attack_respone

   Define the response to the attack *<attack_type>*. *<attack_type>* must be a defined :command:`cyber_attack` type
   or the word 'default', which signifies the attack response to use if an attack is received for which there is
   not a defined attack response.

attack_response Subcommands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. begin

This section defines the commands that occur within the attack_response_.

.. command:: probability_of_scan_detection [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that a scan function will be detected.
   
   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_scan_detection` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.
   
.. command:: probability_of_scan_attribution [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that a scan function will be attributed.
   
   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_scan_attribution` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.

.. command:: probability_of_attack_success [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that an attack will be declared successful.
   
   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_attack_success` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.
   
.. command:: probability_of_status_report [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that the attacker will receive immediate notification of the success or
   failure of an attack.
   
   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_status_report` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.

.. command:: probability_of_attack_detection [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that an attack will be detected by the victim.

   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_attack_detection` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.

.. command:: probability_of_attack_attribution [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that an attack will be attributed by the victim.

   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_attack_attribution` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.

.. command:: probability_of_future_immunity [ 0 .. 1 ]

   The probability threshold that the victim will be immune to future attacks of the same type.

   **Default**: From :command:`cyber_attack.probability_of_future_immunity` in the applicable :command:`cyber_attack`.

.. command:: attack_detection_delay_time <random_time_value>

   The amount of time it takes before the victim become aware of an attack.
   
   **Default**: Infinity
   
.. command:: attack_recovery_delay_time <random_time_value>

   The amount of time it takes for the victim to recover from an attack after it becomes aware of the attack.
   
   **Default**: Infinity

.. command:: IsVulnerable (script)

   .. parsed-literal::
   
      script bool IsVulnerable(:class:`WsfCyberEngagement` aEngagement)
      end_script

   Define an optional script that is invoked when a scan or an attack occurs against the platform.
   This may be used to implement more complex vulnerability assessment based on the operating
   conditions rather than just using random draws.

   The script should return a 'true' if the platform is vulnerable to the scan or attack or
   'false' if not.
   
   If this script returns a 'false' not vulnerable value, then the scan or attack currently in 
   progress will be aborted without providing any notification to the attacker. Note that even if
   this script determines that a victim platform is vulnerable to an attack or scan, the victim's 
   immunity status will still be evaluated in determining whether or not to proceed with the scan
   or attack.
   
   **Default**: Not defined.

.. command:: OnScanDetection (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script void OnScanDetection(:class:`WsfCyberEngagement` aEngagement)
      end_script

   Define an optional script that is invoked when a scan occurs against the platform. This may be used to
   model such effects as notifying others that something suspicious is occurring.

   **Default**: Not defined.
   
.. command:: OnAttackDetection (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script void OnAttackDetection(:class:`WsfCyberEngagement` aEngagement)
      end_script

   Define an optional script that is invoked after an attack has occurred upon the expiration of the
   attack_detection_delay_time_. This might be used to model effects such notify others of the attack.
   
   **Default**: Not defined.
   
.. command:: OnAttackRecovery (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script void OnAttackRecovery(:class:`WsfCyberEngagement` aEngagement)
      end_script

   Define an optional script that is invoked during an attack after the expiration of the
   attack_recovery_delay_time_. This may be used to model such effects as notifying others that they are
   once again operational.
   
   **Default**: Not defined.
