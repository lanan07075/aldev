Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_TRACK_MANAGER_EFFECT` is a cyber_effect that allows user customized behavior
to be injected on the victim when the victim processes tracks via its master track manager.

This effect is defined to affect any matching platform(s) or platform type(s) matching the user specified
target_platform input parameters, and will only affect the platform's master track manager and any other objects
(such as processors) utilizing the master track manager by extension.

Multiple effects of this type acting at the same time on the same victim are processed in the order in which the effects were applied.
This includes multiple effects of this type being used in a single cyber attack definition, in which the user should
order the named effect in the desired order of precedence for the desired behavior.

.. note:: This effect does NOT require user supplied data during a :method:`WsfPlatform.CyberAttack` initiation call.

Commands
========

.. command:: target_platform <platform-name>
.. command:: target_platform <platform-type>

   Specifies either the explicit platform name or platform type that this effect is valid against.
   
.. command:: remove_target_platform <platform-name>
.. command:: remove_target_platform <platform-type>

   Useful for a derived effect type, these commands remove an explicit platform name or platform type that this effect is valid against.

.. command:: inactive_track_purging <boolean-value>

   Defines if this effect allows for inactive track purging during the lifetime of the effect.
   
   **Default** true

.. command:: inactive_raw_track_purging <boolean-value>

   Defines if this effect allows for inactive raw track purging during the lifetime of the effect.
   
   **Default** true
   
.. command:: local_track_history_purging <boolean-value>

   Defines if this effect allows for local track history purging during the lifetime of the effect.
   
   **Default** true

Effect Event Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following scripts may be defined for this effect:

.. parsed-literal::

   script void OnEntry(WsfTrackManager aTrackManager)
   end_script
   
   script void OnExit(WsfTrackManager aTrackManager)
   end_script
   
   script bool OnTrack(WsfTrack aTrack, WsfTrackManager aTrackManager)
   end_script
   
   script bool OnRawTrack(WsfTrack aTrack, WsfTrackManager aTrackManager)
   end_script
   
   script bool OnTrackDrop(WsfTrackId aTrack, WsfTrackManager aTrackManager)
   end_script

The OnEntry script occurs only once, at the same time the effect begins on the victim.

The OnExit script occurs only once, at the same time the effect ends on the victim (if the effect ends).

The OnTrack script is ran any time a track is introduced to the track manager. Upon completion of any user defined
script logic, the user must return true or false, where true indicates to allow the track to be processed by the
master track manager, and false indicates to NOT allow the master track manager to receive this track.

The OnRawTrack script is ran any time a raw track is introduced to the track manager. Upon completion of any user defined
script logic, the user must return true or false, where true indicates to allow the raw track to be processed by the
master track manager, and false indicates to NOT allow the master track manager to receive this raw track.

The OnTrackDrop script is ran any time a track is expected to be dropped from the master track manager. 
Upon completion of any user defined script logic, the user must return true or false, where true indicates to allow the 
track to be dropped by the master track manager, and false indicates to NOT allow the master track manager to drop this track.
