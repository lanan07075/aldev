WsfCyberEngagement
------------------

Navigation: :ref:`cyber_overview`

.. class:: WsfCyberEngagement

Overview
========

WsfCyberEngagement_ objects provide information about an active cyber engagement. Objects of this type
are provided as an argument to various script methods within the cyber framework.

.. warning::
   WsfCyberEngagement_ objects contain data about the most recent attack and scan against the victim by
   an attacker using a particular named attack. Subsequent attacks or scans will invalidate any data
   regarding previous attacks or scans with the exception of developed immunity of the victim platform. 
   In addition, WsfCyberEngagement_ objects are destroyed if the victim platform is removed from the simulation.

General Methods
===============

.. method:: string Attacker()

   Returns the name of the attacking platform.

.. method:: WsfPlatform AttackerPlatform()

   Returns a reference to the attacking platform.
   
.. method:: string AttackType()

   Returns the name of the :command:`cyber_attack` type employed in the attack.

.. method:: string Victim()

   Returns the name of the victim platform.   
   
.. method:: WsfPlatform VictimPlatform()

   Returns a reference to the victim platform.

Cancel Methods
==============

To cancel a pending scan/attack see :method:`WsfSimulation.CyberScanCancel`.

Attack Status Methods
=====================

These methods return detailed information about the engagement.

.. method:: double TimeAttackInitiated()

   Returns the time when the attack was initiated, or a large positive value (>1.0E+30) if an attack has
   not been initiated (e.g.: only a scan has been initiated.)

.. method:: bool AttackStatus()

   Returns true if the attack initiation was successful or false if not.
   
.. method:: int ReportedAttackStatus()

   TODO_CYBER
   
.. method:: double AttackSuccessThreshold()

   Returns the probability threshold for determining if an attack is successful.
   
.. method:: double AttackSuccessDraw()

   The random draw used for determining if an attack is successful.

These methods return detailed information about the engagement.

.. method:: double StatusReportThreshold()

   Returns the probability threshold for determining if a status report is successful.
   
.. method:: double StatusReportDraw()

   The random draw used for determining if a status report is successful.

.. method:: double TimeAttackDiscovered()

   The simulation time when the attack will be detected by the victim, or a very large value (> 1.0E+30) if the
   attack will not be detected.
   
.. method:: double AttackDetectionThreshold()

   Returns the probability threshold for determining if the victim can detect the attack.
   
.. method:: double AttackDetectionDraw()

   The random draw used for determining if the victim can detect the attack.

.. method:: double TimeAttackRecovery()

   The simulation time when the victim will recover from the attack, or a very large value (> 1.0E+30) if the
   victim will not recover from the attack.
   
.. method:: double AttackRecoveryThreshold()

   Returns the probability threshold for determining if the victim can recover from the attack.
   
.. method:: double AttackRecoveryReportDraw()

   The random draw used for determining if the victim can recover from the attack.
   
.. method:: bool Recovery()

   Returns if the victim platform will attempt to recover from an attack.
   
.. method:: double AttackDeliveryDelayTime()

   Returns the time required to simulate the delivery of a payload to the victim.
   
.. method:: double AttackDetectionDelayTime()

   Returns the time required for the victim to determine that is has been attacked.

.. method:: double AttackRecoveryDelayTime()

   Returns the time required for the victim to recover from an attack.
   
.. method:: bool AttackSuccess()

   Returns the success of the current attack against the victim. Will return false if an attack has
   not been initiated or is not completed.
   
.. method:: bool AttackInProgress()

   Returns true if an attack is currently in progress.
   
.. method:: bool AttackInProgress()

   Returns true if an attack is currently in progress.
   
.. method:: int AttackFailureReason()

   Returns an integer that indicates the reason for attack failure. These values are:
   
   * 0 for a random draw
   * 1 for victim immunity
   * 2 for an attack blocked by the victim detecting a previous scan
   * 3 for failing the user defined vulnerability script
   * 4 for no failure due never being attacked, or an attack still in progress
   
Scan-Related Status Methods
===========================

.. method:: double TimeScanInitiated()

   The simulation time when the CyberScan() method was attempted,
   or a very large number (> 1.0E+30) if a scan was never attempted.
   
.. method:: double ScanDetectionThreshold()

   Returns the probability threshold for determining if the victim can detect the scan.

.. method:: double ScanDetectionDraw()

   Returns the probability threshold for determining if the victim can detect the scan.
   
.. method:: double ScanDelayTime()

   Returns the time delay required to simulate the scan of a victim.

.. method:: bool ScanSuccess()

   Returns the success of the current scan against the victim. Will return false if a scan has
   not been initiated or is not completed.
   
.. method:: bool ScanInProgress()

   Returns true if a scan is currently in progress.
   
.. method:: int ScanFailureReason()

   Returns an integer that indicates the reason for scan failure. These values are:
   
   * 0 for victim immunity
   * 1 for the scan being detected by the victim
   * 2 for failing the user defined vulnerability script
   * 3 for no failure due never being scanned, or a scan still in progress
