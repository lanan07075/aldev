Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_TOGGLE_PROCESSORS_EFFECT` is a cyber_effect that allows disabling of one
or more processors on affected victim platforms.

.. note:: This effect does NOT require user supplied data during a CyberAttack initiation call.

Commands
========

.. command:: platform_type <type> ... end_platform_type

   Define the effect targeting for a platform type.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: platform <name> ... end_platform

   Define the effect targeting for a specific platform.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: default ... end_default

   Define the effect targeting parameters for all platforms that are not
   of the provided platform or platform_type definitions.
   
.. note:: This effect attempts to match the most specific case to the victim platform 
          for determination of which block is applicable. Matching is first attempted 
          by platform name, then by all platform_types that the victim derives from 
          (from most to least specific), and finally by using the default block (if defined). 
          If a match is not found due to the default block not being defined and 
          previous matching attempts failing, then this effect will have no affect 
          on the victim platform.

.. _processor_effect_targeting:

Processor Effect Targeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a platform subject to this effect and matching a defined platform, platform_type, or default block,
the following options are provided for determining which processors on the victim are subject to being toggled off:

.. command:: target_list <processor-name> ... <processor-name> ... end_target_list

   A target_list defines the names of the processors that should be disabled by this effect. Any processor name
   matching the provided names will be turned off. All other processors will be unaffected. 
   
.. command:: select_all

   Specifying this command in lieu of the target_list will disable all processors on the victim platform. Defining
   both the select_all and target_list block commands will result in an error in loading the scenario input.
