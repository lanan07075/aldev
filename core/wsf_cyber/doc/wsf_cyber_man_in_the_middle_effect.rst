Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_MAN_IN_THE_MIDDLE_EFFECT` is a cyber_effect that allows the injection of a man-in-the-middle
attack on the victim. The effect will allow the user to drop, delay, and alter any incoming or outgoing 
messages from the victim platform.

Commands
========

.. command:: platform_type <type> ... end_platform_type

   Define the affected comms and effect behaviors for a platform type.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: platform <name> ... end_platform

   Define the affected comms and effect behaviors for a specific platform.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: default ... end_default

   Define the default comms and behaviors of the attack if the victim is not
   of any previously specified platforms or platform types.

.. _comm_effect:

Common Victim Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: target_list ... end_target_list

   Specifies comm devices by name on the victim platform that will be affected by this effect. If a comm is
   listed, but does not exist on the victim platform when the effect is applied, then it will be disregarded.

.. command:: all

   Specifies that all comms on the victim platform will be affected by this effect.

.. command:: exfiltrate <boolean>

   Specifies that this comm should attempt to forward every message it receives back to the attacker. 
   This will attempt to send the message to the first comm on the attacker that is reachable from the victim comm.
   Any message exfiltrated this way will be marked with an :code:`EXFILTRATED_MESSAGE` aux-data field. The forwarded message
   will be marked with the :code:`EXFILTRATION_MESSAGE` aux-data field.

   **Default** false

.. command:: OnSend (script)

   A provided script that will be called when a specified comm attempts to send a message. This script allows
   for the ability to alter, delay, or drop a WsfMessage.

   An example to drop a message is as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::

      script :class:`WsfCyberMitmMessage` OnSend(:class:`WsfMessage` aMessage)
         # Set drop to true to drop the message
         return WsfCyberMitmMessage.Construct(aMessage, 0, true);
      end_script

.. command:: OnReceive (script)

   A provided script that will be called when a specified comm attempts to receive a message. This script
   allows for the ability to alter, delay, or drop a WsfMessage.

   An example to delay a message is as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::

      script :class:`WsfCyberMitmMessage` OnReceive(:class:`WsfMessage` aMessage)
         # Delay the message by 10 seconds
         return WsfCyberMitmMessage.Construct(aMessage, 10, false);
      end_script
