WSF_CYBER_DETONATE_EFFECT
-------------------------

.. model:: cyber_effect WSF_CYBER_DETONATE_EFFECT

.. parsed-literal::

   cyber_effect <effect_name> `WSF_CYBER_DETONATE_EFFECT`

Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_DETONATE_EFFECT` is a cyber_effect that allows for an attacking platform to remotely detonate
specified weapons on the victim platform. When successful, the cyber_effect will continue to detonate 
weapons with the name or type defined in the effect until either all of the weapons are detonated, or the target 
is destroyed. 

Currently, only weapons with base type :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` can be designated for detonation.

.. note:: This effect does NOT require user supplied data during a CyberAttack initiation call.


Commands
========

.. command:: weapon_type <string>

   All weapons that inherit from the specified weapon type (as long as they are of base type :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON`)
   will be detonated upon successful attack.

.. command:: weapon_name <string>

   All weapons on a victim platform that have the specified weapon name (as defined by the user in a scenario) will be
   detonated.

Multiple weapon_types and weapon_names can be specified for a given detonation_effect. As long as a weapon on the platform
has the same name, inherits from the type, or both, the weapon can be detonated, as long as the victim has not yet been destroyed.

Example
========

Note, that on the target platform "test_weapon" is the weapon_name, and "TEST_WEAPON" (along with WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON)
is the weapon_type. 

.. parsed-literal::

   platform target WSF_PLATFORM 
      add weapon test_weapon TEST_WEAPON
         quantity 2
      end_weapon
   end_platform

   platform attacker WSF_PLATFORM
      add processor CYBER_ROCESSOR WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR
         execute at_time 5 sec absolute 
            PLATFORM.CyberAttack(WsfSimulation.FindPlatform("target"), "DETO"); 
         end_execute
      end_processor
   end_platform

   cyber_attack DETO WSF_CYBER_ATTACK 
      effect Deto_Effect
   end_cyber_attack

   cyber_effect Deto_Effect WSF_CYBER_DETONATE_EFFECT
      weapon_type TEST_WEAPON
   end_cyber_effect
