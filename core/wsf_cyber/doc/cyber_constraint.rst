<type>
   The name of the cyber_constraint type being defined.
   
<base_type>
   The name of an existing cyber_constraint type or WSF_CYBER_CONSTRAINT, whose definition will be used as the initial
   definition of the new type.

Instantiation on a platform type:

.. parsed-literal::

    platform_type <type> <base_type>
       cyber_constraint <type>
          ...
       end_cyber_constraint
    end_platform_type
   
Adding cyber_constraint to a platform:

.. parsed-literal::

    platform <name> <type>   # or edit platform <name>
       add cyber_constraint <type>
         ...
       end_cyber_constraint
    end_platform
   
Editing a cyber_constraint object on a platform:

.. parsed-literal::

    platform <name> <type>   # or edit platform <name>
       edit cyber_constraint
          ...
       end_cyber_constraint
    end_platform

Overview
========

The cyber_constraint object defines any restrictions on a platforms ability to make cyber attacks, which includes the methods for C2 information, a cyber resource system, and the ability to affect the offensive probability of an scan/attack. 
Every active platform active in a simulation will have either an explicitly or implicitly define cyber_constraint object.

The object contains zero or more attack_degrade blocks, each of which defines any offensive scan/attack degradation to a particular
type of attack as defined by :command:`cyber_attack`. When an attack is attempted the degrade value will be selected
according to the following algorithm:

1. Attempt to locate the :command:`cyber_constraint.attack_degrade` with the name '<T>'.
2. If step 1 fails, for each :command:`cyber_attack` type that '<T>' inherits from, attempt to locate the
   :command:`cyber_constraint.attack_degrade` whose name matches the inherited type. 
3. If steps 1 and 2 fail attempt to locate the :command:`cyber_constraint.attack_degrade` entry named 'default'.
4. If steps 1, 2 and 3 fail there will be no degradation in probability draws for cyber scans/attacks.
     
For more information about the implementation of a cyber attack please see :ref:`cyber_overview`.

Commands
========

.. command:: resources <double>

   Define the amount of total cyber resource available to the platform to use when launching a cyber_attack. 
   Upon successfully launching a cyber_attack with a resource cost, the resource will be spent. If the cyber_attack
   ends either through its duration finishing, the victim restoring itself, or the victim is destroyed,
   the resources used will be returned to the attacker.

.. command:: attack_degrade [ <attack_type> | default ] ... end_attack_degrade

   Define the degradation to the attack *<attack_type>*. *<attack_type>* must be a defined :command:`cyber_attack` type
   or the word 'default', which signifies the attack degradation to use if an attack is received for which there is
   not a defined attack degradation.

attack_degrade Subcommands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. begin

This section defines the commands that occur within the attack_degrade.

.. command:: degrade_probability_of_scan_detection [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for scan detection.
   The scan is detected if (uniform_draw + degrade < scan_detection_threshold).
   
   **Default**: 0.0
   
.. command:: degrade_probability_of_scan_attribution [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for scan attribution.
   The scan is attributed if (uniform_draw + degrade < scan_attribution_threshold).
   
   **Default**: 0.0
   
.. command:: degrade_probability_of_attack_success [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for attack success.
   The attack is successful if (uniform_draw + degrade < attack_success_threshold).
   
   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: degrade_probability_of_status_report [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for status report availability.
   The status is available if (uniform_draw + degrade < status_report_threshold).

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: degrade_probability_of_attack_detection [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for attack detection.
   The attack is detected if (uniform_draw + degrade < attack_detection_threshold).

   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: degrade_probability_of_attack_attribution [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for attack attribution.
   The attack is attributed if (uniform_draw + degrade < attack_attribution_threshold).
   
   **Default**: 0.0

.. command:: degrade_probability_of_future_immunity [ -1 .. 1 ]

   The value that will be ADDED to the uniform probability draw that is compared against the accepted threshold value for future immunity.
   The attack is immune in the future if (uniform_draw + degrade < future_immunity_threshold).
   
   **Default**: 0.0
