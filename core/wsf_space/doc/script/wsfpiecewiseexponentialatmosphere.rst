WsfPiecewiseExponentialAtmosphere
---------------------------------

.. class:: WsfPiecewiseExponentialAtmosphere inherits WsfAtmosphere

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfPiecewiseExponentialAtmosphere` models the atmospheric density
using a series of exponential profiles for different altitude ranges. In each
range the profile takes the form:

:math:`\rho(h) = \rho_0 \exp{\left[-\frac{h - h_0}{H}\right]}`,

where :math:`H` is a scale height, :math:`h_0` is the altitude at which the
segment begins, and :math:`\rho_0` is the density of the model at that
altitude. The values of these constants can be found in Vallado's
*Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Application*, Fourth Edition, in Table 8-4
on page 567. The values are chosen so that the resulting density is
continuous at the segment boundaries.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfPiecewiseExponentialAtmosphere Construct()
