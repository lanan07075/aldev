WsfConstellationMaker
---------------------

.. class:: WsfConstellationMaker

:class:`WsfConstellationMaker` provides a scripted ability to create
constellations of space platforms. Created constellations can then be managed
with a :class:`WsfConstellation`.

Overview
========

Constellations created by this object are all formed by defining
a set of orbital planes, with each plane having an equal number of members.
The orbits in each plane differ only in the initial anomaly of the member, and
are distributed uniformly around one full orbit. In this way the plane's members
sweep through the same path in the orbital plane, but reach each point in that
path at a different time.

The inclination and the size of the orbits are the same for each member of the
constellation. The RAAN of the orbital planes is spread evenly over a
specifiable range, though this is typically either the full 360 degrees
or 180 degrees.

The relative placement of members of a plane, and those members one plane to the
east is controlled by the inter-plane phasing. This phasing advances the members
of the next plane a given amount in true anomaly.

The RAAN of the first orbital plane, and the true anomaly of the first member of
the first orbital plane can be set to provide fine control over the placement of
the constellation members.

Design Types
""""""""""""

There are three overall design types supported by this object: the general
design, the Walker Delta, and the Walker Star. Each design sets the basic
parameters of the constellation.

 * A general design is defined by the number of planes, :math:`p`, the number of satellites
   per plane, :math:`s`, the inter-plane phasing, :math:`\Delta \nu`, and the range of RAAN
   over which the orbital planes are distributed.

 * A Walker Delta design is defined by the total number of
   satellites, :math:`t`, the number of planes, :math:`p`, and an inter-plane
   phasing given by an integer :math:`f`. A Walker Delta design spreads its
   orbital planes over a full 360 degrees in RAAN.

 * A Walker Star design is defined by the total number of satellites, :math:`t`,
   the number of planes, :math:`p`, and an inter-plane phasing given by an
   integer :math:`f`. A Walker Star design spreads its orbital planes over 180
   degrees in RAAN.

For Walker designs, the number of satellites per plane, :math:`s`, is easily
computed: :math:`s = t / p`. For this reason, :math:`t` must be evenly divisible
by :math:`p`. The Walker :math:`f` parameter is limited to be in the range
:math:`[0, p-1]`. :math:`f` is equivalent to :math:`\Delta \nu`,
with the two related by :math:`\Delta \nu = (360 / t) f`.

Platform Instances
""""""""""""""""""

Constellations created with :class:`WsfConstellationMaker` objects will have
a name. This name controls the names of the platform instances that will ultimately
form the constellation. If the constellation has a name '<name>', then the '<nth>'
member of plane '<plane>' will have the name '<name>_<plane>_<nth>'. For
example, the 0th member of the 4th plane of the constellation named 'sample' will
have the name 'sample_4_0'.

The type of the platform instances created by a :class:`WsfConstellationMaker`
instance is a user-specifiable parameter.

Static Methods
==============

The following methods are static, and can be used to create a :class:`WsfConstellationMaker`.

.. method:: static WsfConstellationMaker CreateGeneral(int aNumPlanes, int aSatellitesPerPlane, double aAnomalyAlias, double aRAAN_Range)

   Return a new instance of a :class:`WsfConstellationMaker` that can be used to generate
   a general constellation. These constellations are defined by the number of satellites
   per plane, the number of planes, the inter-plane phasing parameter in degrees, aAnomalyAlias, and the
   range in RAAN in degrees over which the planes of the constellation are to be spread, aRAAN_Range. If there are any
   input arguments that are out of range, this method will print a message and return an
   invalid object.

.. method:: static WsfConstellationMaker CreateWalkerDelta(int aTotalSatellites, int aNumPlanes, int aWalkerF)

   Return a new instance of a :class:`WsfConstellationMaker` that can be used to generate
   Walker Delta constellations. These constellations are defined by the total number of satellites,
   the number of planes, and the inter-plane phasing parameter, f. If the total number of satellites
   is not evenly divisible by the number of planes, or if the f parameter is not between zero
   and the number of planes minus one, then this method will return an invalid
   object.

.. method:: static WsfConstellationMaker CreateWalkerStar(int aTotalSatellites, int aNumPlanes, int aWalkerF)

   Return a new instance of a :class:`WsfConstellationMaker` that can be used to generate
   Walker Star constellations. These constellations are defined by the total number of
   satellites, the number of planes, and the inter-plane phasing parameter, f. If the
   total number of satellites is not evenly divisible by the number of planes,
   or if the f parameter is not between zero and the number of planes minus one,
   then this method will return an invalid object.

Action Methods
==============

These methods are the main actions taken with this object. This
:class:`WsfConstellationMaker` must be fully set up
(i.e., :method:`WsfConstellationMaker.IsSetup` returns true) to use these methods.
If these are used on an object that is not fully set up, they will print out
the missing or out-of-range parameters to the console.

.. method:: bool DetectConjunction()

   Returns true if the constellation design represented by this object would have
   members that suffer a conjunction with other members of the constellation.
   This method can also return false if this is called on an object that is
   not fully set up.

   This method does not require that the constellation to be created to give
   results; this method is useful for filtering out possible constellation
   designs before they are instantiated.

.. method:: WsfConstellation Create()

   This method will instantiate a set of platforms into the simulation that
   realize the constellation design represented by this object. This method
   returns a :class:`WsfConstellation` object the represents the generated
   collection of platforms. If there is a problem with creating the
   constellation, this method returns an invalid object.

   The platforms created by this method will be added with a creation time
   equal to the simulation time at which this method is called. Further, the
   epoch of the orbits for the platforms created by this method will be set
   to the time at which this method is called.

   The platforms that are created will have the type selected by the user
   (see :method:`WsfConstellationMaker.SetPlatformType`). The platform type
   so specified must exist, and must have a space mover.
   The constellation name (see :method:`WsfConstellationMaker.SetConstellationName`)
   must be unique in a simulation, and be chosen so that no possible member
   platform would be created with a name that is already used by a platform in
   the simulation. If any of these requirements are violated, this method will
   add nothing to the simulation, and return an invalid object.

.. method:: WsfConstellation Create(string aFilterMethodName, string aSetupMethodName)

   This method operates similarly to the previous, but allows for more customization
   by the user via two scripts.

   The first argument, aFilterMethodName, provides the name of a script
   defined in the global context that can be used to filter out some constellation
   members before they are added to the simulation. For each potential constellation
   member, the script named in the first argument is called, and the member is not
   added if the script returns true. The script named in the first argument must
   return a bool and must accept two integer arguments: the first giving the
   orbital plane in which the proposed member would reside, and the second giving
   the satellite number in the plane in which the proposed member would reside.

   As an example, providing the name of the following script as the first argument
   would filter out the constellation member in plane 1, position 3:

   ::

      script bool ExampleFilterScript(int aPlane, int aSatellite)
         bool retval = false;
         if (aPlane == 1 && aSatellite == 3)
         {
            retval = true;
         }
         return retval;
      end_script

   The second argument, aSetupMethodName, provides the name of a script defined in the global
   context that can be used to perform any post-initialization setup for the
   member platforms. After all member platforms have been added to the
   simulation, the script named in the second argument to this function is
   called for each member. The script should return nothing, and accept four
   arguments: the :class:`WsfConstellation` object in which the platform is
   a member; an integer giving the orbital plane of the member; an integer
   giving the satellite number in the plane of the member; and the
   :class:`WsfPlatform` for the member itself.

   As an example, providing the name of the following script as the second
   argument would print out a message detailing each member of the constellation:

   ::

      script void ExampleSetupScript(WsfConstellation aConstellation, int aPlane, int aSatellite, WsfPlatform aMember)
         writeln("Constellation ", aConstellation.ConstellationName(), " has member ",
                 aMember.Name(), " in orbital plane ", (string)aPlane, " position ", (string)aSatellite);
      end_script

   One or both of these arguments can be an empty string, in which case either
   filtering or post-initialization setup is skipped. The zero-argument form
   of this method is equivalent to this method with two empty strings as
   arguments. Scripts with the given names must actually exist, and their
   signatures must conform to the requirements laid out above.

.. method:: bool WriteToFile()

   This method creates an AFSIM input file for the constellation design
   represented by this object. The name of the generated file will be based
   on the name of the constellation: if the constellation has the name
   '<name>', then the generated file will be called '<name>_autogen.txt'. This
   file will be generated into the folder specified by the path set on this
   object (see :method:`WsfConstellationMaker.BasePath` and
   :method:`WsfConstellationMaker.SetBasePath`). If there are any errors
   during this method, a message will be output and this method will return
   false.

Status Methods
==============

.. method:: bool IsSetup()

   Returns true if the constellation parameters have been fully defined, or
   false if they have not been. See :ref:`Setup Methods<WsfConstellationMaker.setup_methods>`
   for details.

.. method:: string Validate()

   Returns a string indicating which constellation parameters are out of range,
   or which have not been defined. The returned string will be empty if there
   are no problems with the constellation parameters.

.. method:: bool IsGeneral()

   Returns true if the constellation that this object will create has a general
   design.

.. method:: bool IsWalkerDelta()

   Returns true if the constellation that this object will create has a
   Walker Delta design.

.. method:: bool IsWalkerStar()

   Returns true if the constellation that this object will create has a Walker
   Star design.

.. _WsfConstellationMaker.setup_methods:

Setup Methods
=============

These methods are used to setup the remaining details of the constellations that
are generated by a :class:`WsfConstellationMaker` that are not set upon initial
creation. If the object is not completely set up using these methods, this object
will be unable to create constellations. With the exception of the base path
(see :method:`WsfConstellationMaker.SetBasePath`), each of the following 
parameters must be explicitly set. Note that there are four equivalent ways
of specifying the size of the orbit.

.. method:: void SetSemiMajorAxis(double aSemiMajorAxis)

   Set the semi-major axis in meters of the orbits for the constellations
   created by this object. This is one of four equivalent ways of specifying
   orbit size.

.. method:: void SetAltitude(double aAltitude)

   Set the altitude in meters of the orbits for the constellations created by
   this object. This is one of four equivalent ways of specifying orbit size.

.. method:: void SetRevolutionsPerDay(double aRevolutionsPerDay)

   Set the number of revolutions per day of the orbits for the constellations
   created by this object. This is one of four equivalent ways of specifying
   orbit size.

.. method:: void SetPeriod(double aPeriod)

   Set the period in seconds of the orbits for the constellations created by
   this object. This is one of four equivalent ways of specifying orbit size.

.. method:: void SetInclination(double aInclination)

   Set the inclination in degrees of the orbits for the constellations created
   by this object.

.. method:: void SetInitialRAAN(double aInitialRAAN_Deg)

   Set the RAAN of the first orbital plane for the constellations created by
   this object.

.. method:: void SetInitialAnomaly(double aInitialAnomalyDeg)

   Set the true anomaly in degrees of the first member of the first orbital
   plane for the constellations created by this object.

.. method:: void SetConstellationName(string aConstellationName)

   Set the name of the constellations created by this object.

   Set the platform type of the member platforms for the constellations
   created by this object.

.. method:: void SetBasePath(Path aPath)

   Set the path of the folder into which any files will be generated. The
   base path defaults to the current working directory.
