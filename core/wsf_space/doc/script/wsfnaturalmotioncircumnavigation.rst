WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation
--------------------------------

.. class:: WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation inherits WsfOrbitalManeuver

**Input type:** :doc:`natural_motion_circumnavigation<../natural_motion_circumnavigation>`

:class:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation` is used to place the executing
platform, called the chaser, into a relative orbit around another platform,
called the target or chief. The chaser will first transfer to the
vicinity of the chief, and then insert into the natural motion circumnavigation.
See :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>` for details.

Several conditions must be met for the transfer orbit to be successful:

.. _conditions:

* The :class:`target point<WsfTargetPoint>` must reference a valid :class:`WsfLocalTrack` with both valid location and velocity;
* The transfer orbit can only be hyperbolic if the mover executing the maneuver supports hyperbolic propagation;
* The transfer orbit must not intersect earth;
* When optimizing, a valid solution must exist for the provided optimization option;
* The expended energy for the transfer must be less than the available delta-v.

  .. note:: The targeting algorithm is direct (less than one orbit).  Phasing orbits are not considered.

Methods
*******

.. method:: static WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation Construct(WsfOrbitalEventCondition aCondition, WsfTargetPoint aTargetPoint, int aOptimizeOption, double aMaximumDeltaTime, double aMaximumDeltaV, double aOrbitSize)

   Create a :class:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation` with the intent of finding an optimal transfer solution in delta-V or time, using the following:

   * **aCondition**:  A specific :class:`WsfOrbitalEventCondition`.
   * **aTargetPoint**: A :class:`WsfTargetPoint` instance specifying the target of this maneuver. This target must be a track target, and should not specify any position or velocity offsets, offset time, or lag time.
   * **aOptimizeOption**: The return value from a :method:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation.EARLIEST_TIME` or :method:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation.LEAST_DELTA_V`.
   * **aMaximumDeltaTime**: The maximum time in seconds after the maneuver begins to consider in computing a solution.
   * **aMaximumDeltaV**: The maximum delta-V in meters per second to consider when computing a solution.
   * **aOrbitSize**: The size in meters of the semi-major-axis of the relative orbit of the chaser around the chief. The provided value must be greater than zero.

.. method:: static WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation Construct(WsfOrbitalEventCondition aCondition, WsfTargetPoint aTargetPoint, WsfOrbitalOptimizationCost aCost, double aMaximumDeltaTime, double aMaximumDeltaV, double aOrbitSize)

   Create a :class:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation` with the intent of finding an transfer solution minimizing the provided cost function, using the following:

   * **aCondition**:  A specific :class:`WsfOrbitalEventCondition`.
   * **aTargetPoint**: A :class:`WsfTargetPoint` instance specifying the target of this maneuver. This target must be a track target, and should not specify any position or velocity offsets, offset time, or lag time.
   * **aCost**: A :class:`WsfOrbitalOptimizationCost` instance specifying the cost function to minimize.
   * **aMaximumDeltaTime**: The maximum time in seconds after the maneuver begins to consider in computing a solution.
   * **aMaximumDeltaV**: The maximum delta-V in meters per second to consider when computing a solution.
   * **aOrbitSize**: The size in meters of the semi-major-axis of the relative orbit of the chaser around the chief. The provided value must be greater than zero.

.. method:: static WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation Construct(WsfOrbitalEventCondition aCondition, WsfTargetPoint aTargetPoint, double aDeltaTime, double aOrbitSize)

   Create a :class:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation` without optimizing the transfer. If all prerequisite conditions_ are met, the transfer will take the specified time to complete once the maneuver begins.

   * **aCondition**:  A specific :class:`WsfOrbitalEventCondition`
   * **aTargetPoint**: A :class:`WsfTargetPoint` instance specifying the target of this maneuver. This target must be a track target, and should not specify any position or velocity offsets, offset time, or lag time.
   * **aDeltaTime**: The time after the maneuver begins when the transfer is planned to complete.
   * **aOrbitSize**: The size in meters of the semi-major-axis of the relative orbit of the chaser around the chief. The provided value must be greater than zero.

.. method:: int EARLIEST_TIME()

   Attempt to optimize the maneuver such that it will execute at the earliest possible time, up to delta-t and delta-V constraints provided during construction.

.. method:: int LEAST_DELTA_V()

   Attempt to optimize the maneuver such that it will execute with the least possible delta-v, up to delta-t and delta-V constraints provided during construction.

.. method:: double OrbitSize()

   Return the relative semi-major-axis in meters of the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`).

.. method:: double OrbitPhase()

   Return the phase of the insertion point in degrees for the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`). Unless :method:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation.SetOrbitPhase` has been called on this object, this will return the default value of 0.

.. method:: double OutOfPlaneAmplitude()

   Return the out-of-plane amplitude in meters for the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`). Unless :method:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation.SetOutOfPlaneAmplitude` has been called on this object, this will return the default value of 0.

.. method:: double OutOfPlanePhase()

   Return the out-of-plane phase in degrees for the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`). Unless :method:`WsfNaturalMotionCircumnavigation.SetOutOfPlanePhase` has been called on this object, this will return the default value of 0.

.. method:: void SetOrbitSize(double aOrbitSize)

   Set the relative semi-major-axis in meters of the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`). The provided size must be greater than zero.

.. method:: void SetOrbitPhase(double aOrbitPhase)

   Set the phase of the insertion point in degrees for the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`).

.. method:: void SetOutOfPlaneAmplitude(double aOutOfPlaneAmplitude)

   Set the out-of-plane amplitude in meters for the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`). The provided value must be non-negative.

.. method:: void SetOutOfPlanePhase(double aOutOfPlanePhase)

   Set the out-of-plane phase in degrees for the resulting natural motion circumnavigation (see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <../nmc_details>`).
