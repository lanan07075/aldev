WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm
----------------------

.. class:: WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm` represents one source of acceleration for
platforms having a :class:`WsfIntegratingSpaceMover`. Orbital dynamics terms
are member of a series for a :class:`WsfOrbitalDynamics` object which supplies
the full acceleration for a platform. See also :ref:`Dynamical Term <orbital_dynamics_terms>`.

Methods
=======

.. method:: string TermType()

   Return a string identifying the type of term.

.. method:: Vec3 ComputeAcceleration(double aMass, Calendar aTime, Vec3 aPosition, Vec3 aVelocity)

   Compute the acceleration for this term on an object with the given mass,
   position and velocity at the given time. Some dynamics terms will be unable
   to provide a non-zero result for the acceleration because they rely on runtime
   information available only when attached to an orbital dynamics, Please see the individual
   term types below.

Available Orbital Dynamics Terms
================================

The following orbital dynamics terms are available for use in AFSIM:

* :class:`WsfEarthMonopoleTerm`
* :class:`WsfEarthJ2Term`
* :class:`WsfMoonMonopoleTerm`
* :class:`WsfSunMonopoleTerm`
* :class:`WsfJupiterMonopoleTerm`
* :class:`WsfAtmosphericDragTerm`
* :class:`WsfScriptedDynamicsTerm`
