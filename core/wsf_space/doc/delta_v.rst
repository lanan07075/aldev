Delta_V
-------

**Script Type:** :class:`WsfDeltaV_Maneuver`

.. parsed-literal::

   :ref:`maneuver<orbital_event.maneuver>` delta_v
      :ref:`Common Maneuver Commands ...<orbital_event.common_commands>`
      delta_v_ ...
   end_maneuver

A maneuver representing a change in the platform's ECI velocity.

.. command:: delta_v <frame> <speed-value> <speed-value> <speed-value>

   The desired change in the velocity of the platform, given in the specified orbital reference frame.

   The allowed value for the reference frame are:
    * **inertial** for a velocity change given in the inertial frame (typically the :ref:`ECI` frame, but this may represent equivalent frames for other central bodies if the platform is being evolved with a central body other than the Earth);
    * **ric** for a velocity change given in the executing platform's RIC frame.

.. command:: dv_x <speed-value>

   The desired change in the ECI x component of the velocity.

   .. note:: This command is deprecated. Please use delta_v_.

.. command:: dv_y <speed-value>

   The desired change in the ECI y component of the velocity.

   .. note:: This command is deprecated. Please use delta_v_.

.. command:: dv_z <speed-value>

   The desired change in the ECI z component of the velocity.

   .. note:: This command is deprecated. Please use delta_v_.
