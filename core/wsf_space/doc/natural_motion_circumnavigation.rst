.. block:: natural_motion_circumnavigation

Perform a maneuver that brings the executing platform into a natural motion circumnavigation (NMC) of another platform.
The resulting motion of the executing platform is the superposition of an elliptical relative orbit in the orbital
plane of the target platform, and a harmonic oscillation in the out-of-plane direction. For details on the relative
orbit, please see :doc:`Natural Motion Circumnavigation Details <nmc_details>`.

In addition to the final relative motion, the executing platform will perform maneuvers similar to a
:doc:`rendezvous` to transfer from its initial orbit to the final NMC. Because of this transfer,
this maneuver also has many options that overlap with :doc:`rendezvous`.

.. command:: target_platform <string-value>

   The target platform around which the executing platform will perform a NMC.

.. command:: orbit_size <length-value>

   The semi-major-axis of the relative orbit.

.. command:: orbit_phase <angle-value>

   The phase along the relative orbit at which the executing platform will be inserted into the NMC.

.. command:: out_of_plane_amplitude <length-value>

   The amplitude of the out-of-plane oscillation.

.. command:: out_of_plane_phase <angle-value>

   The phase in the harmonic oscillation at which the executing platform will be inserted into the NMC.
