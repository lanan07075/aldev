Overview
========

:model:`WSF_ORBITAL_CONJUNCTION_PROCESSOR` monitors the 
containing :class:`WsfPlatform`'s master track list and predicts over the
search_interval_ if any of the tracked objects might suffer a conjunction with 
one of the named primary_ objects. This processor inherits all the functionality
of the  :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR` and adds to it in the following ways. 

At the end of each update of the processor the master track list of the owning 
platform is examined with each track categorized between primary and secondary 
objects. The generated list of primary_ tracks correspond to the spacecraft of 
particular interest to the processor. The secondary tracks are any other 
tracks in the space spatial domain in the owning platform's master track list.
For each primary_ track, each other primary and secondary track is examined for 
possible conjunctions. This prediction is made out to search_interval_ from 
the time at which the update is performed.

For each pair, a fast filter is used to quickly remove pairs of tracks that 
cannot possibly suffer a conjunction using the geometry of the orbits. The cut 
is performed by examining the periapsis and apoapsis of the two orbits. If the
closest possible approach is larger than filter_cut_distance_, then the pair
is ignored.

Close approaches are predicted by taking a series of steps along the orbit
and interpolating between the start and end of the step. This allows for
relatively large steps to be taken, reducing the computational burden of this
processor. The size of the steps is set by search_step_size_.

For each pair, when a close approach is predicted, the processor will compute
a number of quantities including, the maximum probability of conjunction, the
time and miss distance of the point of closest approach, and the times that
the two objects enter into the encounter region, defined to be the combined
error ellipsoid, scaled by the exclusion_factor_.

After all possible conjunctions are found, the processor will call the script
defined on the processor named on_conjunction_predicted_, if it exists. The 
arguments to this function will be a collection of :class:`WsfOrbitalConjunctionReport`
objects containing the details of the possible conjunctions. These reports will
be sorted so that the earlier conjunctions appear earlier in the :class:`Array\<T\>`.

Commands
========

.. command:: search_interval <time-value>

   Declares the time tracked objects will be predicted into the future to 
   search for conjunctions. This search is performed anew during each update,
   and this duration begins at the time of the update. The means that a
   conjunction can be predicted during more than one update if this interval
   is long enough.

.. command:: filter_cut_distance <length-value>

   Declares the distance used in the fast filter.

   **Default:** 10 km.

.. command:: search_step_size <angle-value>

   Declares the step size used in prediction. As this angle is made larger, the
   amount of computation needed by the processor is decreased, at the cost of
   some additional error.

   **Default:** 3 deg.

.. command:: exclusion_factor <real-value>

   Declares the size of the exclusion zone as the combined covariance ellipsoid
   scaled by this factor.

   **Default:** 8.0.

.. command:: default_variance <length-value>

   Declares a default position variance for cases where the track does not have 
   state covariance data. In those cases, the covariance ellipsoid is taken to
   be a sphere with this radius.

   **Default:** 10.0 m.

.. command:: default_object_size <length-value>

   Declares an object size used in the computation of the conjunction
   probability. The probability estimate is sensitive to the size of the object,
   so reasonable values should be used.

   **Default:** 1.0 m.

.. command:: prediction_model <string>

   Declares the prediction model used by the processor, which can be one of the
   following:

   **default**

      Use the propagator as in the :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`. This is the most
      appropriate choice when tracking platforms with a 
      :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`. This is the default value.

   **norad**

      Use the propagator as in the :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER`. This is the
      most appropriate choice when tracking platforms with a 
      :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER`.

      Note that this processor works on tracks, and so the predictions produced
      will be slightly less accurate than if the processor used truth
      information.

.. command:: primary <string> ... end_primary

   Declare a list of objects by name to be considered as primary objects.

.. command:: debug

   Turn on additional output concerning the operation of this processor.

Script Interface
================

All of the methods defined in :class:`WsfProcessor` are available to
scripts defined within this processor.

.. command:: on_conjunction_predicted

   .. parsed-literal::
   
      script void on_conjunction_predicted(Array<:class:`WsfOrbitalConjunctionReport`> aReports) ... end_script

   This is an optional script that can be defined that allows one to react to
   the discovery of a possible conjunction. If defined, this script is only
   called if conjunctions are discovered, so the input Array will always have
   at least one entry.
