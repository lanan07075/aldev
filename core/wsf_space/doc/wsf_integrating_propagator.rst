Overview
========

|PROPAGATOR_MODEL| implements an orbital propagator for a platform in the space domain. Unlike
:model:`WSF_KEPLERIAN_PROPAGATOR` or :model:`WSF_NORAD_PROPAGATOR`, which both use an analytical model to
provide the future state of a platform, the |PROPAGATOR_MODEL| uses numerical
integration. By using a specifiable dynamical model, this propagator is not limited to the cases
of interest for those two propagators, namely, propagation where the Earth plays the dominant role in
the dynamics.

Users of |PROPAGATOR_MODEL| need to select an integrator and a dynamical model
to fully specify the behavior of this propagator. The integrator specifies exactly how the state of the
platform is numerically propagated forward in time. The dynamical model specifies the forces that
the platform will experience.

.. note:: If the dynamical models require terms that depend on the mass of the platform, the platform will need to have a mass specified. This can be accomplished by explicitly setting the mass on the platform, or by using a rocket maneuvering model in the associated :model:`WSF_INTEGRATING_SPACE_MOVER`.
