Special Note
============

Please see :ref:`This Conversion Guide <Convert_RIPR_To_Quantum_Guide>` for tips on how to convert a scenario from using
jobs and RIPR Processors to using the new Quantum Tasker.

Overview
========

The Reactive Integrated Planning aRchitecture (RIPR) is an artificial intelligence framework that allows scenario
developers to quickly create flexible agents with sophisticated behaviors.  RIPR agent scripts are typically
constructed with the behavior tree technology (now on all script processors in WSF); please see the :command:`behavior_tree`
page for more info.  Many commander/subordinate agent pairs make uses of the job board technology.  The job board is a
task allocation system and is exposed to scenario developers via the :class:`WsfRiprProcessor` and the :class:`WsfRIPRJobb`
classes.

RIPR is part of the baseline WSF release and consists of the following classes:

* :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR` / :class:`WsfRiprProcessor`
* :command:`behavior_tree` (now on :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`)
* :class:`WsfRIPRJob`

Getting Started
===============

#. Most RIPR functionality is used by writing scripts in the WSF scripting language.  Refer to the :ref:`WSF_REFERENCE_GUIDE`
   for detailed information on the available scripting capabilities.
#. The :command:`behavior_tree` technology is the best way to make your behavior scripts modular, reusable, & easy to edit.
#. The job board task allocation system is accessible via the :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR` class any any types that derive from
   it.  Job boards can be used to provide dynamic, adaptable command and control to a hierarchy of intelligent agents.
#. For an example of RIPR agents in a scenario, see *scenario_gci-cluster* in the unclassified WSF analyst repository
   under *ripr_training/13.gci-cluster/*. The striker platform in this scenario is a RIPR agent, it uses the
   aiai_processor defined in *site_types/processors/ripr_agents/aiai*.

Examples / Explanations
=======================

* :ref:`RIPR_Resource_Allocator` - example on how to use RIPR for coordinated jamming.
* :ref:`RIPR_Scenarios` - more explanation about a scenario with RIPR agents in the command hierarchy.

Trouble Shooting
================

Please reference the :ref:`RIPR_Trouble_Shooting_Guide` for steps to debug your agents.

Object Types
============

WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR
******************

:model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR` is the processor that houses the job board technology. If you want a platform or agent to use
the bottom-up job job board bidding system, then they should use a :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR`.  Please see the
:model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` for other options.
