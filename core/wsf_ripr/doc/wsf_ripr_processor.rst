Overview
========

WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR is the foundation for all :ref:`RIPR` agents in WSF.  Most RIPR agents are built using a
:command:`behavior_tree`, now defined on the :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`.  Any new :ref:`RIPR` agent classes should
inherit from :class:`WsfRIPRProcessor`.  The RIPR processor's unique offering is the job board, and any agents that wish to
take advantage of the bottom-up job bidding system should utilize this processor.  A different option would be the
:model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR`.

Commands
========

.. command:: channel_job_type  <channel-index> <job-type>

   Specifies that the indicated channel on this RIPR agent processor will be allowed to bid on and win jobs of the
   indicated type.  If no types are specified for a channel than all types are allowed on that channel.  The channel-index
   is an integer value and the job-type is a string that equals the job name (also called the job type).  Users can
   specify many job types for particular channels, or one, or none.  If a particular channel bids on a job of type that is
   not allowed, that bid is ignored.  A job of the wrong type will never be awarded to a channel.

   Default: all types allowed on all channels

.. command:: job_board_comm  <comm-name>

   Specifies the name of a comm device that all job interactions will take place over.  This includes bidding, status
   update, and winning jobs.

   Default: no comm defined, job interactions completed instantly and perfectly

.. command:: job_pass_through

   If specified, this RIPR processor will simply act as a pass-through for jobs and bids.  If asked for its jobs or job
   board, it will reply with its commander's jobs or job board.  It will not hold any jobs on its own board.
   Subsequently, all bids from its subordinates go up to its commander and its subordinates will win jobs from its
   commander's job board.

   Default: not specified (not a pass-through)

.. command:: job_stickiness  <real-value>

   A RIPR processor's job stickiness is the value used to provide a little extra stability to the current job allocation.
   When a RIPR processor has won a job and is performing that job, then all of it bids on that job are multiplied by the
   job_stickiness value.  In this way, it's harder to dislodge somebody from their job once they have won it.

   Default: 1.5  (bids are increased by 50% if the bidder has already allocated the job)

.. command:: num_job_channels  <integer-value>

   The number of channels a RIPR processor has represents its capability to perform jobs at the same time.  If the RIPR
   processor is bidding on tracking jobs and its radar can track four targets at once, then it might have four job
   channels.  This way, each channel can bid on jobs, win jobs separately, and allow the agent to perform them
   concurrently.  The responsibility lies with the scenario developer to use the channels.  The extended forms of these
   methods must be used to specify the channel index as parameter **aChannelIndex**, referenced here::

    void BidJob(WsfRIPRProcessor aProc, int aChannelIndex, double aBid, double aProgress)

    :class:`WsfRIPRJob` JobFor(WsfRIPRProcessor aProc, int aChannelIndex)

   BidJob( ) is used when adding your bid to a job (usually from your commander's job board).  GetJobFor( ) is used when
   querying your commander for the job you've won, based on the bids you have previously provided.

   Default: 1

.. command:: auto_exclusive_mode  <boolean-value>

   If set to true, the RIPR processor job board will use the time values given with "job_window_open_length" and
   "bid_window_open_length" to automatically alternate the windows for job bidding and job awarding of the job board
   according to the proper durations.  While the bidding window is closed, all bids given to the job board are ignored.
   While the job window is closed, all jobs maintain a constant allocation (nobody changes jobs).

   Default: false

.. command:: bid_window_open_length  <time-value>

   Specifies the amount of time the bidding window will be open each cycle. While the bidding window is closed, all bids
   given to the job board are ignored.

   Default: 0 (must be user defined)

.. command:: job_window_open_length  <time-value>

   Specifies the amount of time the job window will be open each cycle. While the job window is closed, all jobs maintain
   a constant allocation (nobody changes jobs).

   Default: 0 (must be user-defined)

.. command:: max_weapon_uplinks  <integer-value>

   Specifies the maximum number of active uplinks the RIPR agent is capable of.

   Default: 1

.. command:: use_remote_tracks_for_uplink  <boolean-value>

   If set to true, the RIPR processor will send tracks from any sensor and any source to weapons it is supporting with an
   uplink.

   Default: false

.. command:: weapon_uplink_path  <sensor-name> <comm-name>

   If a weapon uplink path is specified for a RIPR processor, then the processor will support uplinks for all fired
   weapons.  It will send track updates over the designated comm to the fired weapon platform using tracks from the
   designated sensor.  Uplinks can be stopped and started from script, see :model:`WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR`.

   Default: no uplinks

.. command:: query_bid_type  <job-type>

   Determines and returns an agent's bid on a given job of the indicated type.  No other query_bid_type block for the same
   job type is allowed to be defined on this agent.  The script method :method:`WsfRIPRProcessor.QueryBid`
   will execute this block on the given job. You can access the job object by using the "JOB" keyword within the
   query_bid_type script block.  This input is the preferred and explicit method for providing bid values from agents.

DEPRECATED
==========

.. command:: query_bid

   This input block is obsolete and now deprecated.  See the "query_bid_type" script block definition above.
