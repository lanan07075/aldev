WsfRIPRProcessor
----------------

.. class:: WsfRIPRProcessor inherits WsfProcessor

Job Board Management
====================

Bidding
^^^^^^^

.. method:: void ClearBidsFor(WsfRIPRProcessor aProc)
            void ClearBidsFor(WsfRIPRProcessor aProc, int aChannelIndex)
   
   Clears all bids from aProc for the jobs on the job board.  If aChannelIndex is specified (for multichannel agents) the
   job bids for that channel are cleared.

.. method:: double QueryBid(WsfRIPRJob aJob)
   
   Returns the highest bid of all subordinates. If aExpandPassThroughs is set to **true** it will also include
   subordinates of subordinates in a recursive manner. aExpandPassThroughs is **true** by default. This call will execute
   the :command:`query_bid <WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR.query_bid>` script block on the calling processor.

.. method:: double QuerySubordinatesMaxBid(WsfRIPRJob aJob)
            double QuerySubordinatesMaxBid(WsfRIPRJob aJob, bool aExpandPassThroughs)
   
   Returns the highest bid of all subordinates. If aExpandPassThroughs is set to **true** it will also include
   subordinates of subordinates in a recursive manner. aExpandPassThroughs is **true** by default. This call will execute
   any :command:`query_bid <WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR.query_bid>` script blocks on subordinate processors.

Channels
^^^^^^^^

.. method:: Array<string> ChannelJobTypes(int aChannelIndex)
   
   Returns an array of all the job types (job names) that can use the channel indicated by aChannelIndex as specified by
   the :command:`channel_job_type <WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR.channel_job_type>` input command.  If the returned array is empty, then all
   job types can use the indicated channel.

.. method:: Array<int> JobTypeChannels(string aJobType)
   
   Returns an array of all the channels that aJobType (job name, also called job type) is allowed to use as specified by
   the :command:`channel_job_type <WSF_RIPR_PROCESSOR.channel_job_type>` input command.  If the returned array is empty, then the
   job type can use all channels on the agent processor.

.. method:: int NumJobChannels()
   
   Returns the number of job channels (for multichannel agents).  An agent can make bids for jobs for each of its channels
   and win bids for each of those channels separately.  If the agent didn't have "num_job_channels X" specified in its
   RIPR processor script input block, then it is not a multichannel agent and this method will return 1, the default.

.. method:: void SetNumJobChannels(int aNumChannels)
   
   Sets the number of job channels on an agent from script, during run-time.  This overrides whatever the script input
   "num_job_channels X" specified in its RIPR processor script input block.

Job Board
^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: bool IsBidWindowOpen()
   
   Returns true if the job board bid window is open and false otherwise.  The job board will only accept bids if the
   window is open.

.. method:: bool IsJobWindowOpen()
   
   Returns true if the job board job window is open and false otherwise.  The job board will only assign jobs if the
   window is open.

.. method:: int JobAllocationMode()
   
   Returns a numeric value that identifies the allocation mode being used by the agent's job board.

   * 0 == Spread

      * Default -- The job board attempts to find a maximum profit matching between subordinates and jobs.  If there are more jobs (or job slots, for jobs that can accept multiple winners) than there are subordinates (or bid channels among all subordinates) then some subordinates (or bid channels) will be left idle.

   * 1 == Greedy

      * Every subordinate is given the job he bids highest on with the highest priority, without regard for the maximum number of winners that the job allows.  Every subordinate will get a job. (Disregards Job Stickiness value)

   * 2 == CoverThenGreedy

      * Like spread, but remaining unassigned subordinates will be given the job they bid highest on with the highest priority, even if that results in the job having more winners that the maximum specified.  This mode may be preferable to Spread if you don't want to hold subordinates in reserve and don't mind some jobs being over-performed.

   * 3 == CoverThenSpread

      * Like spread, but remaining unassigned subordinates will be spread out over the pool of jobs with no job getting two extra winners before all jobs have one extra winner.  This mode may be preferable to Spread if you don't want to hold subordinates in reserve and don't mind some jobs being over-performed.

   * 4 == StrictPriority

      * Awards the highest priority job to the highest bidder regardless of the bidder's highest overall bid or the total profit of the system.

.. method:: bool JobPassThrough()
   
   Returns whether or not the processor has been designated as a pass-through processor. If **true**, the RIPR processor
   will pass any jobs down to subordinate RIPR processors and any bids up to its commander processor and will not process
   them.

.. method:: void SetBidWindowOpen(bool aOpen)
   
   Sets the state of the job board bid window.  The job board will only accept bids if the window is open.

.. method:: void SetJobAllocationMode(int aMode)
   
   Sets the job allocation mode of the agent's job board to aMode.

.. method:: void SetJobPassThrough(bool aPassThrough)
   
   Sets the pass-through flag on the processor. If **true**, the RIPR processor will pass any jobs down to subordinate
   RIPR processors and any bids up to its commander processor and will not process them.

.. method:: void SetJobStickiness(double aScaleFactor)
   
   Sets the job stickiness on the agent's job board.  Job stickiness is simply a scale value that is multiplied onto an
   agent's bid for a job if he is currently a winner for that job.  It is very common for a scenario to set the stickiness
   of all agents down to 1.0 so that bids can be tightly controlled by agent script.  The default value of stickiness
   increases an agents bid on a job by 50% if he is currently the winner for that job.
   
   Default: 1.5

.. method:: void SetJobWindowOpen(bool aOpen)
   
   Sets the state of the job board job window.  The job board will only assign jobs if the window is open.

Jobs
^^^^

.. method:: void AddJob(WsfRIPRJob aJob)
   
   Adds aJob to the agent's job board.

   .. parsed-literal::

      // Create a job with various parameters
      :class:`WsfRIPRJob` newJob = :class:`WsfRIPRJob`.Create(PROCESSOR, newJobName, newJobDescription, newJobPriority, newJobMaxWinners);
   
      // add newJob to my job board
      AddJob(newJob);

.. method:: int DeleteCompletedJobs()
   
   Deletes completed jobs from the agent's job board and returns the number of jobs deleted.

.. method:: WsfRIPRJob GetJobByData(string aDataKey, Object aDataValue)
   
   Returns the job with data matching the (aDataKey, aDataValue) key/value pair.
    
   .. parsed-literal::

      :class:`WsfRIPRJob` tempJob = CommanderProcessor().GetJobByData(dataKey, dataValue);

.. method:: WsfRIPRJob GetJobById(int aID)
   
   Returns the job with the ID number aID.

.. method:: WsfRIPRJob JobFor(WsfRIPRProcessor aProc)
            WsfRIPRJob JobFor(WsfRIPRProcessor aProc, int aChannelIndex)
            WsfRIPRJob JobFor(double aSimTime, WsfRIPRProcessor aProc)
            WsfRIPRJob JobFor(double aSimTime, WsfRIPRProcessor aProc, int aChannelIndex)
   
   Returns the job won by aProc, if any.  If aChannelIndex is specified (for multichannel agents) the job for that channel
   is returned, if any. Often used like:

   .. parsed-literal::

      :class:`WsfRIPRJob` mCurrentJob = CommanderProcessor().JobFor(TIME_NOW, PROCESSOR);

.. method:: Array<WsfRIPRJob> Jobs()
   
   Returns an array of all the jobs on the agent's job board.  Often used by an agent to get the jobs from his commander's
   job board, like so:

   .. parsed-literal::

      // get all jobs from my commander's job board
      Array<:class:`WsfRIPRJob`> jobs = CommanderProcessor().Jobs();

.. method:: int PurgeDeadTakers()
   
   Remove from all jobs any bidders who are no longer present in the simulation.

.. method:: void RemoveAllJobs()
   
   Removes all jobs from the agent's job board.

.. method:: void RemoveJob(WsfRIPRJob aJob)

   with the platforms of all the threats.

Weapon Uplink Management
========================

.. method:: bool IsUplinkingTo(WsfPlatform weaponPlatform)
   
   Queries whether or not the RIPR processor has an active uplink to the given weapon platform.  Does not check if the
   comm is successful or if the weapon is even alive.  It simply checks if the RIPR processor thinks it has an uplink.

.. method:: bool StartUplinking(WsfPlatform weaponPlatform)
            bool StartUplinking(WsfPlatform weaponPlatform, WsfTrack targetTrack)
   
   Starts the RIPR processor sending track uplinks to the weapon platform specified.  The second form receives a track
   that represents the weapon's target.  If the track is not specified, and the first form is used, then the weapon's
   current target is used (common way).

.. method:: bool StopUplinking(WsfPlatform aPlatform)
   
   Has the RIPR processor stop all track uplinks to the weapon platform specified.  The weapon will then need to receive
   tracks from somebody else or from its own sensor(s).

.. method:: bool UplinkCapable()
   
   Queries whether or not the RIPR processor is capable of weapon uplinks, which is determined by whether or not the
   'weapon_uplink_path' script input was used.  If a valid weapon_uplink_path was included in the processor definition,
   then the processor is uplink capable.  The sensor and comm used by the weapon_uplink_path must be valid.

.. method:: int UplinkCount()
   
   Queries for the number of active uplinks that the RIPR processor has.

.. method:: WsfPlatform UplinkPlatformEntry(int aUplinkIndex)
   
   Returns the weapon platform for the specified uplink, referenced by index (zero based).
