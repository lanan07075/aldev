// PROGRAMMING NOTE: About thread-safety.
//
//         DO NOT MODIFY THIS CLASS IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION!
//
// Every instance of this class contains a pointer to a SharedTypeData object that contains the
// type data for instance (it's type, base type and complete type list). In order to save space and
// time, all instances of of the same type point to the same shared type data.
//
// Thread-safety is a concern only for OBJECTS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN A SIMULATION (that is, one that
// has directly or indirectly been initialized and added to the simulation). Thread-safety is not
// a consideration during scenario loading as it is not considered thread-safe and must be run in a
// single thread. However, cloning of instances from a scenario to create the simulation instances
// must be thread-safe enough to ensure multiple simulations running in parallel do not cause issues.
// The thread-safety of UtSharedPtr ensures that level of thread-safety.
//
// The main concern is the use of SetType ON AN OBJECT ACTIVE IN A SIMULATION (as defined above).
// In general, calling SetType ON AN ACTIVE OBJECT MUST NOT BE DONE because it can cause reallocation
// of the shared type data. In a multi-thread environment other threads using GetType, GetTypeList or
// IsA_TypeOf could reference deleted memory if SetType is called at just the wrong time. The window
// is very, very narrow, but in theory it could happen.
//
//     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
//     | The general rule is then: DO NOT USE SetType ON AN OBJECT ACTIVE IN A SIMULATION! |
//     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
//
// It is conceivable that code could call SetType, but it would be easy to search for such occurrences.
// But for this reason, SetType is NOT exposed to script because it would be very difficult to find
// all of the uses.
//
// A mutex could be used to allow for complete thread-safety, but the performance losses caused by
// locking all calls to GetType, GetTypeList and IsA_TypeOf shouldn't be incurred because of something
// that shouldn't be allowed anyhow!
//
// ANOTHER NOTE: The type list is stored as a vector for code compatibility and performance reasons.
// In the early implementations it was a vector and stored in reverse order from the current form.
// It is now most-specific -> least-specific (It used to be the other way around, but in practice
// most callers really wanted it in the most-specific -> least-specific order.) It was then converted
// to a UtImmutableList. Callers had to be modified not only call 'toVector' to get a vector from the
// list, but also to reverse the direction in which they processed the vector. The current code once
// again uses a vector, but in order to avoid having to again change the order in which callers
// traversed the list, the code now inserts at the front of the vector when adding new types to the
// type list. This is generally a no-no on vectors, but these vectors are very small. A <list> would
// have been better from this stand point, but the callers would have been forced to convert to use
// iterators rather than vector indices as was commonly done. The old code looked like:
//
//    WsfObject::TypeList typeList = objectPtr->GetTypeList().toVector();
//    for (size_t i = 0; i < typeList.size(); ++i)
//
// The new syntax is:
//
//    const WsfObject::TypeList& typeList = objectPtr->GetTypeList();
//    for (size_t i = 0; i < typeList.size(); ++i)
//
// The first statement is exactly what the code looked like prior to the use of UtImmutableList. The
// caller can simply eliminate the '.toVector()' and leave the rest of the statement, but it would not
// be as efficient because it would cause a copy of the vector.
//
// The performance hit from inserting elements at the front of the vector should be small because
// The number of elements is small and is done only when reading the scenario.
