Overview
========

Provides the capability to define IFF reporting behavior for all entities in the simulation.

Commands
========

.. command:: side  <side-name> ... <side-name> | [default]
   
   One or more sides for which the IFF mapping rules apply. If **default** is specified then the IFF mapping rules apply
   to all sides not explicitly defined.

.. command:: side-name 
   
   The 'side' ('team' or 'affiliation') for which the IFF mapping applies. Refers to blue, red, country or team name.

.. command:: reports [friend | foe | neutral]
   
   Indicates the IFF status to report for the given side, category, or by default.

.. command:: for_side  <side-name>
   
   Indicates the IFF mapping between sides.

.. command:: for_category  <category-name>
   
   Indicates the IFF mapping between platforms from a given side and platforms from a given category.

.. command:: by_default 
   
   Indicates the IFF mapping between platforms form a given side and all sides and categories not explicitly mapped.


An example of IFF mapping entries - Sides 'blue', 'green', and all other sides in the simulation except 'white' reports
side 'red' as foe, any platforms in 'myCategory' as friend, and all other sides and categories as neutral. Side 'white'
reports side 'red' as friend and with all other sides and categories as foe.::

 iff_mapping
   side blue green default
      reports foe     for_side     red
      reports friend  for_category myCategory
      reports neutral by_default
   end_side
   side white
      reports friend for_side red
   end_side
 end_iff_mapping
