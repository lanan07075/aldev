Overview
========

A router object represents a device that provides the ability to determine if a message can
be sent to its destination, and which path that message should take to reach its destination.
It is associated uniquely with comm interfaces on the same platform that use the router instance
when messages are sent and received.

Any number of routers may be used on a platform instance, but each comm may only be associated
with a single router. This allows the usage of multiple routers with unique comm interfaces on
every platform instance in AFSIM.

By default, every platform in AFSIM has a router, and unless specified, all comms will be assigned to this default router.

.. note:: The default router has the name "default". If users want to override the default router settings, they simply need to define and assign a router to the platform using the same name, "default".

Default router behavior may be modified with the usage of :command:`router_protocol` commands.

.. note::
   The router is required at this time to be on and operational upon instantiation in the simulation
   to support legacy communications behavior. The :ref:`Platform_part_commands` that initially disable
   the router are not currently supported, and will not affect the router object. However, usage of
   the :class:`WsfPlatformPart` script methods that disable or turn off the router will still function. 
   It is expected that these commands will be fully supported in AFSIM 3.0.

All comm interfaces assigned to a router with connections between those comms are considered bridged,
in that communications can pass between them regardless of the comm model type and reception/transmission
restrictions defined on the comm model. Thus, the router object assumes the capabilities previously
provided directly via the comm bridge command.

.. command:: gateway_address <address>

   If provided, defines the particular interface associated with this router that should be used
   to forward messages if the router is unable to find a destination for a message received on
   one of the router's defined comm interfaces. The destination used for the selected comm gateway
   is defined on the comm itself.
   
   This command provides a static addressing alternative to the gateway_ command, and only one of
   these commands should be used on any given router.
   
   **Default** No gateway address specification or usage.
   
.. command:: gateway <comm-name>

   If provided, defines the particular interface associated with this router that should be used
   to forward messages if the router is unable to find a destination for a message received on
   one of the router's defined comm interfaces. The destination used for the selected comm gateway
   is defined on the comm itself.
   
   This command provides a dynamic addressing alternative to the gateway_address_ command, and only one of
   these commands should be used on any given router.
   
   **Default** No gateway specification or usage.
   
.. command:: hop_limit <integer>

   Specifies the number of nodes/comms that a message may visit on the way to the destination before the 
   message is simply discarded. Often referred to as time to live (TTL).  The hop_limit applies to any 
   messages initiated from this router's interfaces. This value ensures that messages that may enter 
   circular routing are eventually dropped.
   
   **Default** 64
   
.. command:: automated_interface_linking <boolean-value>

   If set to true, all interfaces specified for this router will have connections created between members.
   This ensures that router interfaces are correctly represented as having direct connections to each other
   via the router hardware interface.
   
   If set to false, no connections will be automatically created between members, and messages sent or
   received from any particular interface on the router may not be able to reach another interface on
   the same router.
   
   .. warning:: Some network types are not compatible with automated_interface_linking_, and the user should not enable this setting if the network topology will be violated.
   
   **Default** false
   
.. command:: use_default_protocol <boolean-value>

   A convenience setting to determine if the router should use the default legacy routing protocol.
   True indicates to use this routing_protocol, false to remove it.
   
   **Default** true
   
.. command:: use_multicast_protocol <boolean-value>

   A convenience setting to determine if the router should use the default multicast routing protocol.
   True indicates to use this routing_protocol, false to remove it.
   
   **Default** true
