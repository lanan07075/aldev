Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_LEGACY` provides a generic routing capability
that was present in previous versions of AFSIM. By default, it is added
to every router instantiation in AFSIM. Be default, this routing protocol
works on truth based data provided by the simulation, thus any actual
pathway to a destination is useable by the router, or in the case of EM
comms (such as radio), that the destination is known for sending a message.

The protocol has no additional input at this time.

It is highly suggested that if using a more robust routing protocol, to
remove this protocol from any comm, as any failure of routing typical to
a more complicated and limited routing protocol will still succeed, as the
legacy protocol will be queried for routing if all other protocols fail.
