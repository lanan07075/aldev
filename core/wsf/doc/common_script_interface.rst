.. _Common_Script_Interface:

Common Script Interface
-----------------------

Many WSF components use the WSF 'common script interface'. An WSF component that uses the interface will accept:

* Definitions of script variables: **script_variables** ... **end_script_variables**
* Definitions of scripts: **script** ... **end_script**
* Scripting system control commands (e.g., :command:`_.script_commands.script_call_trace`)
* `Common Scripts`_ (defined below)

The WSF components that currently implement common script interface include:

* The simulation.
* The platform.
* Some processors such as :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`, and many others.
* Some other platform parts, such as sensors. 

Example::

 processor my-script-proc WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR
    update_interval 10 sec
    on_update
       writeln("T=", TIME_NOW, " ", PLATFORM.Name(), " is updating");
    end_on_update
 end_processor

Predefined Variables
====================

All components that use the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface` will have the following predefined variables as is appropriate
for the component:

double TIME_NOW

   The current simulation time in seconds. This is available to all scripts.

:class:`WsfPlatform` PLATFORM

   A reference to the platform. This is valid only within the platforms, sensors, and processors that implement the
   common script interface

   .. note::
      This is not available in simulation-level scripts.

:class:`WsfProcessor` PROCESSOR

   A reference to the processor. This is valid only in processors that use the common script interface (e.g.,
   :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`).

   .. note::
      This variable is not available in simulation-level or platform-level scripts

:class:`WsfSensor` SENSOR

   A reference to the :command:`sensor`. This is valid within AFSIM's predefined sensors, as well as any other sensors that use the common script interface. 

   .. note::
      This variable is not available in simulation-level or platform-level scripts
	  
:class:`WsfRandom` RANDOM

   A reference to the random number generator used by the simulation. 
   
   .. note::
      Use of this object will affect the simulation's random draws and therefore repeatability of simulation outcomes.
   

Common Scripts
==============

Every WSF component that uses the common script interface will accept the following common scripts:

.. command:: execute at_time <time-value> [ absolute | relative ] ...script body... end_execute
             execute at_interval_of <time-value> ...script body... end_execute

   These commands allow you define a script that is to execute once at a specific time or repeatedly at a specified time
   interval.

   To execute a script at a specific time:

   .. parsed-literal::

    execute at_time :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>` [ absolute | relative ]
       :ref:`Script Body <script>`
    end_execute

   If **absolute** is specified then the script will be executed at the specified simulation time.

   If **relative** is specified then the script will be executed at the specified time relative to the creation time of the platform.

   To execute a script repeatedly at a specified interval:

   .. parsed-literal::

    execute at_interval_of :argtype:`\<time-value> <time-value>`
       :ref:`Script Body <script>`
    end_execute

   .. note::
      If defined in the context of a processor, these scripts will execute even if the
      system is turned off as the purpose of the script may be to turn the system on!

.. command:: on_initialize ...script_body... end_on_initialize

   This command lets one define a script that is executed during phase 1 of platform initialization, if defined within the context of a platform, or during simulation initialization, if defined in the global script context.

   During phase 1 initialization one may not assume anything about the state of the platform or any other platform
   component. If such a requirement is needed use the on_initialize2 script defined below.

   .. parsed-literal::

    on_initialize
       :ref:`Script Body <script>`
    end_on_initialize

.. command:: on_initialize2 ...script_body... end_on_initialize2

   This command lets one define a script that is executed during phase 2 of platform initialization. Phase 2
   initialization occurs when all platforms and their components (including those in the same platform context)
   have completed phase 1 initialization. Furthermore, phase 2 initialization at the platform context only occurs
   after phase 1 initialization at the global context.

   .. note::
      The on_initialize2 command is not available in the global (simulation-level) script context.

   .. parsed-literal::

    on_initialize2
       :ref:`Script Body <script>`
    end_on_initialize2

.. command:: on_update ...script_body... end_on_update

   This command lets one define a script that is executed whenever the platform or processor is updated. When
   specified within the context of a processor, the "update_interval' command defines the interval at which the
   simulation invokes the "Update' method.

   .. note::
      Use this with great caution at the platform level as it can have severe performance impacts. The on_update command is not available in the global (simulation-level) script context.

   .. parsed-literal::

    on_update
       :ref:`Script Body <script>`
    end_on_update
