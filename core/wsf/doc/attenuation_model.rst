attenuation_model

Overview
========

attenuation_model is used to create configured *attenuation models* that can be referenced in the
:command:`_.transmitter.attenuation_model` block in a :command:`_.transmitter` definition.

**<derived-name>** is the name you wish your configured attenuation model to be assigned. *<derived-name>* is the name by
which the user wishes to refer to the configured attenuation model.

**<base-name>** is one of the `Available Attenuation Models`_:

* none_
* simple_
* itu_
* blake_
* :model:`WSF_TABULAR_ATTENUATION`

Effective Use Of Attenuation Models
===================================

An attenuation model definition may be embedded directly in the definition of a radar. For example, assume you have a
file called 'ex_radar.txt':

::

 sensor EX_RADAR WSF_RADAR_SENSOR
    transmitter
       ... transmitter commands ...
       attenuation_model itu
          ... itu model commands ...
       end_attenuation_model
    end_transmitter
    receiver
       ... receiver commands ...
    end_receiver
 end_sensor

The problem with this method is that one must modify the radar definition to change or eliminate the attenuation model.
In many production uses this is undesirable or infeasible. What would be more desirable is to provide a 'default'
attenuation model definition that can be overridden.

The new 'ex_radar.txt' would now contain::

 # Define the 'default' attenuation model
 attenuation_model EX_RADAR_ATTENUATION itu
    ... itu model commands ...
 end_attenuation_model

 sensor EX_RADAR WSF_RADAR_SENSOR
    transmitter
       ... transmitter commands ...
       attenuation_model EX_RADAR_ATTENUATION # References the attenuation model symbolically
    end_transmitter
    receiver
       ... receiver commands ...
    end_receiver
 end_sensor

Then to override the attenuation model::

 #include ex_radar.txt

 # Provide a new definition that overrides the existing definition.
 # This example now uses the **blake** attenuation model.

 attenuation_model EX_RADAR_ATTENUATION blake
 end_attenuation_model

The radar model will use the **last** definition of EX_RADAR_ATTENUATION when it finally creates instances of the radar
in the simulation.

Available Attenuation Models
============================

none
****

A 'dummy' attenuation model that results in no effect.::

 attenuation_model *<derived-name>* none
 end_attenuation_model

.. _attenuation_model.simple:

simple
******

.. block:: attenuation_model.simple

This model provides a mechanism to specify either a constant specific attenuation (signal loss per unit length) or a
constant factor (attenuation is always the same). This model is applicable when one has conditions which are relatively
geometry independent and don't require the calculation of a more complex model. It is also applicable for some simple
cases that may not be handled by other models.

Either one of the following can be specified:

.. command:: specific_attenuation <value> <db-ration-unit>/<length-unit>
   
   Specifies the signal loss per unit length. This would be applicable where the paths are nearly parallel to the Earth's
   surface (such as in air-to-air where the participants are at approximately the same altitude).
   
   This is loss factor (appears in the denominator) and is generally specified as a positive db/km (which results in a
   value greater than or equal to 1).

   Example::

     specific_attenuation 0.001 db/km

.. command:: attenuation_factor <db-ratio-value>
   
   Specifies a constant multiplier (gain factor) of the signal value. The factor must be in the range [ 0 .. 1 ] in
   absolute units (a dB value less than zero). This option would be applicable where the geometry is fixed (or nearly so),
   such as communications between two ground stations or between a ground station and a geosynchronous satellite.
   
   Example::

     attenuation_factor -3.0 db

.. _attenuation_model.itu:

itu
***

This model determines the attenuation factor for RF signals with a frequency of 1-1000 GHz using the methods defined in
the following recommendations from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU):

* "ITU Recommendation ITU-R P.676-8, Attenuation by atmospheric gases".
* "ITU Recommendation ITU-R P.838-3, Specific attenuation model for rain for use in prediction methods".
* "ITU Recommendation ITU-R P.840-4, Attenuation due to clouds and fog".

The contribution of attenuation due to rain is computed only if the :command:`global_environment.rain_rate` is defined in
the :command:`global_environment`. If :command:`global_environment.rain_altitude_limit` is not specified then it will use the
lower value of :command:`global_environment.cloud_altitude_limits` . If that value is not defined then it will use the value
of 10000 meters.

The contribution of attenuation due to clouds or fog is computed if :command:`global_environment.cloud_altitude_limits` and
:command:`global_environment.cloud_water_density` are defined in the :command:`global_environment`.

The model integrates along the path through a series of 1 km thick layers of the Earth's atmosphere. The integration
will not go above 30 km unless the rain or cloud altitude limits are higher, and the respective rain rate or cloud
water density is provided. (The additional attenuation by atmospheric gases is negligible above 30 km).

*****

This model determines the attenuation factor using the atmospheric absorption model written by L.V. Blake, Naval
Research Laboratory. This is based on a family of 42 attenuation curves for frequencies between 100 MHz and 10 GHz and
elevation angles between 0 and 10 degrees. The curves are flat beyond 300 nautical miles. These tables were published
in 'Radar Systems Analysis, Section 15.1, David K. Barton, Artech Publishing.''

.. note::
   This selection is valid only where either the transmitter or the target are on (or are very near) the
   surface.
