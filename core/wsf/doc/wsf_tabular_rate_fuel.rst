Overview
========

:model:`WSF_TABULAR_RATE_FUEL` specifies a fuel consumption rate model.  It defines fuel consumption behavior at either
constant rates (zero independent variables), or at variable rates based upon one to three independent variables (the
choices are platform altitude, mass (weight), and speed).  By default, :command:`fuel` mode is ignored, and only one table is
accepted; but multiple tables may be defined for different modes if desired.  The active table is switched by setting
the :command:`fuel` mode, unless there is no table defined for the new mode, in which case the active table will not change.

This model differs from the similar :model:`WSF_VARIABLE_RATE_FUEL`, in several ways; namely that :model:`WSF_TABULAR_RATE_FUEL`
tables must be rectangular (the number of dependent variables (rates) must match the product of the number of each of
the independent variables (number of speeds * number of weights * number of altitudes)), and :model:`WSF_TABULAR_RATE_FUEL`
allows for 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D tables.   (:model:`WSF_VARIABLE_RATE_FUEL` input format is more flexible for the user, but it
does not allow for 3-D table creation; it is maintained for backward compatibility with certain applications.)

Inside the fuel_table_ block for multi-dimensional tables, the user may list the speeds, altitudes, or weights
blocks in any order.  The IV listed first will be considered the "outer" slowest changing index in the table, while the
last IV listed will be considered the "inner" fastest changing index.  The corresponding rates block must them have the
outer, middle, and inner indices changing likewise.  (Internally, the table lookup routines are more computationally
efficient if the IV which varies the most is selected as the inner index, which is preferred.)  See Example3D at bottom
of page.

.. note::
   All independent variable arrays may be unevenly spaced, but there must be at least two values and the
   values must be in ascending order.

.. note::
   In this parlance, a fuel_table is being defined, even if it is a single constant fuel flow rate value.

Commands
========

.. command:: fuel_table ... end_fuel_table
    :block:

    One or more fuel_table blocks may be provided.

    .. command:: mode  <mode-name>

        This specifies the fuel mode that a table is valid for.  If only one fuel flow table is supplied, and is to be
        used regardless of the :command:`fuel` mode, then do not supply this value.  If multiple fuel rate tables are provided, then
        each table must be supplied this discriminator, to allow switching between tables.  Fuel mode is accessible for change
        via script interface.

    .. command:: constant  <mass-flow-value>

        This specifies a constant fuel consumption rate.

    .. command:: speeds  units <speed-units> <speed_1> ... <speed_2> end_speeds

        This specifies an independent variable arbitrary-sized array of speed values (must be in increasing order) that
        will apply to the independent fuel flow rate values that follow. This command is mutually exclusive with the mach command.

    .. command:: mach <mach_1> ... <mach_2> end_mach

        This specifies an independent variable arbitrary-sized array of mach values (must be in increasing order) that
        will apply to the independent fuel flow rate values that follow. This command is mutually exclusive with the speeds command.

    .. command:: altitudes  units <length-units> <altitude_1> ... <altitude_n> end_altitudes

        This specifies an independent variable arbitrary-sized array of altitude values (must be in increasing order)
        that will apply to the independent fuel flow rate values that follow.

    .. command:: weights  units <mass-units> <mass_1> ... <mass_n> end_weights

        This specifies an independent variable arbitrary-sized array of weight values (must be in increasing order) that
        will apply to the independent fuel flow rate values that follow.  (The keyword "masses" is equivalent.)

    .. command:: masses  units <mass-units> <mass_1> ... <mass_n> end_masses

        This specifies an independent variable arbitrary-sized array of mass values (must be in increasing order) that
        will apply to the independent fuel flow rate values that follow.  (The keyword "weights" is equivalent.)

    .. command:: rates  units <mass-flow-units> <mass_flow_1> ... <mass_flow_n> end_rates

        This specifies the dependent variable values corresponding to the 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D independent variables that
        precede this keyword.  The number of values supplied *must* match the product of the number of independent values in
        each supplied dimension (i.e. a table of 6 speeds and 4 altitudes must contain 24 fuel flow values).
