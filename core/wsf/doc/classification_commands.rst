Overview
========

The classification_ command is used to specify the classification level_, caveats_ and trigraphs_ associated with a particular input
file or scenario. If multiple classification_ blocks are encountered within the scenario, the trigraphs and caveats are aggregated
(duplicates removed) and the level of the scenario is set to the highest level found. The highest level is determined by the
classification_levels_ block, in which levels are defined in order of increasing degree of sensitivity, and optionally with a color_
to use when displaying the level in the GUI applications. In the example below, *HIGHEST* is more sensitive than *HIGHER*, which is
more sensitive than *HIGH*. The aggregated scenario classification string, including level, caveats and trigraphs, is echoed to
the console and displayed in a banner within the GUI applications. The classification string and color are also accessible via script
with the :method:`ClassificationString<WsfSimulation.ClassificationString>` and :method:`ClassificationColor<WsfSimulation.ClassificationColor>`
methods of :class:`WsfSimulation`.

.. note::

   The format of the scenario classification string is as follows:
   **Level//Trigraph-1//Trigraph-2//...//Trigraph-N - Caveat-1//Caveat-2//...//Caveat-N**

.. note::

   A classification_ command can be placed within any file in the scenario, but it must come after the classification_levels_ block that
   defines the levels. Therefore, there is an input file order dependency.

Example:

.. parsed-literal::

    classification_levels_
      level_ HIGH    color_ yellow end_level
      level_ HIGHER  color_ red    end_level 
      level_ HIGHEST color_ orange end_level
    end_classification_levels

    classification_
      level_ HIGHER
      caveats_ ABC DEF end_caveats
      trigraphs_ RST XYZ end_trigraphs
    end_classification

    ...
    ...

    classification_
      level_ HIGHEST
      caveats_ DEF GHI end_caveats
      trigraphs_ RST UVW end_trigraphs
    end_classification
    
The resulting aggregated classification string would be as follows:
**HIGHEST//RST//UVW//XYZ - ABC//DEF//GHI**
   
Commands
========

.. command:: classification_levels ... end_classification_levels
   :block:

   Used to define the list of potential classification levels in a scenario, in order of increasing degree of sensitivity.

   .. note::

      It is an error to define multiple classification_levels_ blocks.

   .. command:: level <string> ... end_level
      :block:

      Defines a level that can be used in classification_ blocks.
   
      .. command:: color <color-value>
   
         Optionally define the color to be used when displaying the level in the classification banner within the GUI applications.
   
         **Default**: black

         .. note:: The alpha component of the color will not be used in the classification banner even if specified.

   .. end::

.. end::

.. command:: classification ... end_classification
   :block:
   
   .. command:: level <string>
   
      Specifies the classification level of the input file or scenario. An error will occur if the level string does not appear in the classification_levels_ block.
      
      **Default**: None

   .. command:: caveats <caveat-1> <caveat-2> ... <caveat-n> end_caveats

      Specifies the caveats associated with the classification. Each caveat is a string literal specified by the user. The user can provide as many caveats as needed.
   
      **Default**: None

   .. command:: trigraphs <trigraph-1> <trigraph-2> ... <trigraph-n> end_trigraphs

      Specifies the trigraphs associated with the classification. Each trigraph is a string literal specified by the user. The user can provide as many trigraphs as needed.
   
      **Default**: None

.. end::
