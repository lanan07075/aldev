Overview
========


:command:`masking_pattern` defines a *masking pattern* for :command:`comm` or :command:`sensor`) systems (i.e., those things
that are based on :command:`articulated parts <_.articulated_part>`. A masking pattern is used to model the effects of
structural obscuration. The masking pattern consists of one or more collections of azimuth/elevation tables where each
collection defines the masking pattern that applies when the system is in a particular 'state'.  A 'state' represents a
condition such as 'bay-doors-open.'

The collection for a given state consists of either or both of a platform-relative table  platform_factor_ and a
part-relative table part_factor_. Each table is an azimuth/elevation table where the dependent value is a number
in the range [0 .. 1]. The value represents the fraction of the signal that is passed. Typical values are 1 (no
blockage) or 0 (complete blockage), but intermediate values may be used to represent angle-dependent reduction. If a
table has both a platform_factor and a part_factor then the resulting fraction passed is the product of the two values.

Masking patterns are available for all of the core WSF sensors and communications devices.

Commands
========

.. command:: pattern-name
   
   The name to be given to the pattern. This is the name that is referenced by the :command:`_.articulated_part.masking_pattern` 
   on a :command:`comm` or :command:`sensor` device. A pattern may be redefined, with the last occurrence being
   used.

.. command:: state  [ <state-name> | default ]
   
   Indicates that the following table definition(s) will be used when the articulated is in the state *<state-name>*.  If 
   **default** is specified then the subsequent table will be used if the articulated part is in a state that does not
   match any of the states defined in the signature.
   
   If a **state** command is not specified, then the pattern has one table that applies to all states.
   
   There are script commands in :class:`WsfArticulatedPart` that allow the application to query
   (:method:`WsfArticulatedPart.MaskingPatternState`) or modify (:method:`WsfArticulatedPart.SetMaskingPatternState`) the
   masking pattern state.

.. command:: platform_factor
   
   Indicates the following table defines a platform-relative masking pattern. The azimuth and elevation angles in the
   table are relative to the platform.

.. command:: part_factor
   
   Indicates the following table defines a part-relative masking pattern. The azimuth and elevation angles in the table a
   relative to the part.
   
   Part-relative tables are generally used when a turret-mounted system is employed and there is blocking structure
   attached to the turret.

Example
=======

The following table blocks everything from 20-30 degrees and 110-120 degrees out the right side.
