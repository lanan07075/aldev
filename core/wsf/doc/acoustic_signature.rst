    <signature-name>
       Name to be given to the signature.  This must be unique among all acoustic signatures. A particular signature may be
       redefined, with the last definition being used.

Overview
========

**acoustic_signature** defines an acoustic signature for a platform type.  It is used when an acoustic sensor attempts to detect a platform.  The acoustic signature consists of one or more tables where each table defines the signature that applies when the platform is in a particular 'state'.  A 'state' represents a condition such as 'landing-gear-down'.


Commands
========

.. command:: data_reference_range <length-value>

   The reference range that the following acoustic data was calculated or measured at. This value is used to adjust the
   following acoustic data to a zero slant range value.

.. command:: state [ <state-name> | default ]

   Indicates that the following table definition will be used when the platform is in the signature state <state-name>.
   If **default** is specified then the subsequent table will be used if the platform is in a signature state that does
   not match any of the states defined in the signature.

   If a **state** command is not specified then the signature has one signature table that applies to all signature states.

.. command:: freq <frequency-value>

   1/3 octave center frequency of signature value.

   .. note:: These must occur in increasing order within a single state.

.. command:: noise_pressure <noise-pressure-value>

   Acoustic noise pressure (dB/20 uPa) at specified 1/3 octave center frequency.
