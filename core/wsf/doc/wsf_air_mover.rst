Overview
========

:model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER` is a :ref:`Route_Mover` designed for simplified air vehicle motion.  The advantage of using the
WSF_AIR_MOVER is that a platform's mass properties, aero, or
propulsion is not required to be known to model an air body.  Movement is based on maximum limits set for items (e.g.,
linear acceleration, velocity, Gs, radial acceleration), but it applies only to the continuous motion in the horizontal
plane. The limitation of the WSF_AIR_MOVER is within the vertical transitions (altitude changes) of the platform. These
transitions are discontinuous in that the effects are instantaneous because transitional vertical pitch rates and
vertical accelerations are not modeled.  If continuous and smooth vertical and horizontal transitions are desired on a
platform, use the :model:`WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER` (if no aerodynamics, mass properties, propulsion, or altitude effects are
desired) or the :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` (if realistic, physics-based modeling is desired).

Mover Commands
==============

.. command:: update_interval <time-value>

   If non-zero, specifies a periodic time interval at which the simulation will call the mover.  If zero then the mover
   will be called only when it is necessary to determine the position of the containing platform.

   Default: 0 seconds unless overridden by the specific mover implementation.

.. command:: update_time_tolerance <time-value>

   When a position update is requested by the simulation, if the time since the previous update is less than or equal to
   this value then the mover will ignore the update.

   Default: Most mover implementations define this as the time it takes to travel 1 meter at some nominal velocity that is
   appropriate for the implementation.

   .. note::

      A mover implementation may choose to ignore this command.

Air Mover Commands
==================

.. command:: maximum_impact_speed <speed-value>

   Specify the maximum speed above which the associated platform intersects :command:`terrain` and is considered 'crashed into
   the ground'.  A crashed platform will notify observers via the WsfSimulationObserver::CrashedIntoGround() method and
   remove itself from the simulation.  If impact speed is below this maximum, the platform is considered to be 'landing'.
   The default behavior is to always land, rather than crash.
