Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_NETWORK_MESH_LEGACY` provides a generic network that enforces a mesh topology. Only members are
specified in this network. Unlike the standard mesh network, this network will only create links between objects
that are capable of communicating to each other at the time of the network creation. For example, two radio based
comms that are not within communications distance will not create initial links in the network. 

This network object was the default network implementation in previous versions of AFSIM. All default created
networks in AFSIM continue using this network object when otherwise unspecified.

Commands
========

.. command:: comm_list ... end_comm_list

   Members of this network may be specified by identifying a comm object by its owning platform name and 
   the name of the comm. Each entry in this list is prefixed by the "member" command.

.. command:: address_list ... end_address_list

   Members of this network may be specified by identifying a comm object by its address. Each entry in this
   list is prefixed by the "member" command. This list is only available to comm objects that have specified
   addresses in input, as comms without specified addresses will be dynamically allocated at runtime.
