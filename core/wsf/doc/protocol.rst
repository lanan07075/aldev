Overview
========

A (comm) protocol is an abstract representation of a particular comm capability.
It can provide or restrict functionality from the norm, and may alter many of the
layer processes on the comm with which it is associated. Any activity that is defined
within the logic of the comm model OSI 7-layer implementations may be modified
to the extent of the protocol API. As such, every layer in all existing comm models
in AFSIM query all attached protocols in the receive/send 
protocol stack during normal comm operation, giving each protocol an opportunity
to modify the execution of message processing.

At a more general level, this allows capabilities to be defined external to the
comm object, and added or removed as seen fit by the user. Any number of protocol
types may be defined, but only one of each type can be used. Assuming that each
protocol is compatible (dependent on the implementation), they can all function
to the degree that they wish to cooperate (i.e. multiple transport layer protocols can't
all control how a message is split into packets; one of them has to be primary).

Again, note that each comm should only have one of each type. In the current version
of AFSIM, no protocols are used by default.
