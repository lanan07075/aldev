Adding a medium_ to a valid communication framework object:

.. parsed-literal::

    comm <name> <type>   # or edit comm <name>
       add medium <type>
         ...
       end_medium
    end_comm

Editing a medium_ object on a valid communication framework object:

.. parsed-literal::

    router <name> <type>   # or edit router <name>
       edit medium <type>
          ...
       end_medium
    end_router

Deleting a medium_ object on a valid communication framework object:

.. parsed-literal::

    comm <name> <type>   # or edit comm <name>
       delete medium <type>
    end_comm

Note that deleting a medium replaces the existing definition with the
default medium type with default settings for this object.

Overview
========

A medium is an object based representation of the means by which a communications device
propagates data to another communication device.

Mediums provide a definable user type that can be utilized by various objects within the AFSIM
communications framework. Mediums define the limitations imposed on communications by their
implementation, working in conjunction with the limitations defined by the communications model
that uses the medium. For example, even though a communication device may utilize a maximum
transfer_rate, that rate may be further limited by the medium being used, or other characteristics
dynamic to the medium (such as the number of channels being utilized in multiplexing).

Mediums are unique in that they may be shared between multiple communication objects in AFSIM. As such,
every communication device using a shared medium is restricted by the limitations of such a medium. For
example, a medium shared between four comm devices may have four channels available for transmission. If
one comm is using all four of those channels, all other comm devices cannot transmit until one or more of
those channels are available for usage. Particular models may implement their own restrictions based on
concepts such as interference, congestion, etc.

Because mediums are shared objects, they are only definable in the global context. Any utilization of
a medium specific to a comm object (such as a router or a comm) must refer to a medium defined in
the global context, and only refers to such a medium by its type name.

Mediums may also contain multiple modes, indicating different states associated with that medium. Using
the AFSIM scripting language, the state used for any transmission may be modified during runtime
to provide a dynamic method to change transmission characteristics. While any object in AFSIM is limited
to a single medium object, that medium may have any number of modes available for usage.

Commands
========

.. command:: channels <integer-value>

   Defines the number of channels available to a medium, in other words, if multiplexing is available.
   The number of channels determines how many concurrent transmissions may be handled by this medium,
   and subsequently by all communication objects utilizing this medium.

   Default **maximum integer value** (no restriction on number of concurrent transmissions)

.. command:: default_mode_name <mode-name>

   Specifies the default mode to be used for transmissions over this medium. Every medium has a default
   mode named as "default" using default values. Unless this command is used, the "default" mode
   will be used during typical medium processing. Note that the default mode may be modified by
   explicitly defining the "default" mode using the mode command.

   Default **Use of the "default" mode**

.. command:: use_sharing <boolean-value>

   By default, mediums are shared between every object that refers to a particular globally defined
   medium type. If use_sharing is indicated to be false, then this medium type definition will result
   in every usage of this medium instantiating their own instance. This allows the type definition to
   act as a simple template for each instance, while avoiding sharing the actual medium itself.

   Default **true** (mediums are shared)

.. command:: mode <mode-name> .. end_mode

   The mode command is used to define an individual mode for this medium. It may be repeated any number
   of times, with the restriction that each mode must have a unique string name. The actual commands
   available for any given mode is determined by the medium type being used.

   .. note:: Every medium has a "default" mode. Any usage of typical mode commands outside of the mode block refers to the "default" mode.

.. command:: ModeOnTransmit (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script string ModeOnTransmit(:class:`WsfCommMessage` aMessage, :class:`WsfComm` aTransmitter, :class:`WsfComm` aReceiver)
      ...
      end_script

   Defines an optional script method that is invoked every time a message is attempting transmission over
   this medium. A user may specify the mode intended for transmission over this medium by returning the string identifier for the mode.

   By returning an empty string when this method is called, or a mode name that does not exist, the medium
   will use the currently specified default mode for this message transmission.
