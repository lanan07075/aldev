Antenna Commands
----------------

Overview
========

.. note::
   This section is just a reference for the various commands.

.. note::
   Antenna commands are valid for anything that uses an electromagnetic antenna, including :command:`_.transmitter`, :command:`_.receiver`, and :model:`radar beams <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`.

.. note::
   When the range and altitude limits are used in multiple places, such as on both transmitter and receiver, then precedence is given to the last entry that is read.

.. block:: _.antenna_commands

Commands
========

.. command:: antenna_height <length-value>

   Defines the subsystem's height relative to the platform it is attached to.

.. command:: antenna_pitch <angle-value>
.. command:: antenna_tilt <angle-value>

   Defines the subsystem's orientation in the pitch plane relative to the platform. This is primarily intended to specify
   the tilt angle of antenna for simple rotating systems.

   .. note::
      This command **must not** be used for multi-beam radars (e.g., A :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` in which
      multiple beams are defined). In those cases the **beam_tilt** command in the :command:`_.transmitter.beam_tilt` and
      :command:`_.receiver.beam_tilt` blocks should be used.

   .. note::
      The :command:`_.articulated_part.pitch` command should be used to specify the tilt of fixed
      mount systems, however fighter AESA systems should use this command if they are going to employ scan stabilization.

   .. note::
      This command **must not** be used if the :command`_.articulated_part.pitch` is used.

.. command:: minimum_altitude <length-value>

   Defines the minimum relative altitude the subsystem is able to observe a target.

   **Default** negative infinity

   .. note::
      This value is only used for initial screening to determine if the subsystem can potentially interact
      with another object.

   .. note::
      If the altitude limit is intended to be below an antenna, then the limit should be entered as a
      negative number.


.. command:: maximum_altitude <length-value>

   Defines the maximum relative altitude the subsystem is able to observe a target.

   **Default** infinity

   .. note::
      This value is only used for initial screening to determine if the subsystem can potentially interact
      with another object.

   .. note::
      If the altitude limit is intended to be below an antenna, then the limit should be entered as a
      negative number.

.. command:: minimum_range <length-value>

   Specify the minimum range at which the system can interact with another object.

   **Default** 0.0

   .. note::
      This value is only used for initial screening to determine if the subsystem can potentially interact
      with another object.


.. command:: maximum_range <length-value>

   Specifies the maximum range at which the subsystem can interact with another object.

   **Default** infinity

   .. note::
      This value is only used for initial screening to determine if the subsystem can potentially interact
      with another object.


.. command:: electronic_beam_steering  [ none | azimuth | elevation | both | azimuth_and_elevation ]

   Specifies that the subsystem uses an electronically-steered antenna that is capable of being electronically steered in
   the specified directions.  When specified, the antenna gain is a function of the cosine of the angle relative to the
   array center. When enabled, the command affects the returned beamwidths of
   :command:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.error_model_parameters.azimuth_beamwidth` and
   :command:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.error_model_parameters.elevation_beamwidth`.

   * **none** - The beam is not electronically steered.
   * **azimuth** - The beam is electronically steered in azimuth.
   * **elevation** - The beam is electronically steered in elevation.
   * **both** or **azimuth_and_elevation** - The beam is electronically steered in both azimuth and elevation.

   **Default** **none**

.. command:: electronic_beam_steering_loss_exponent <value>

   Specifies the exponent that will be used in the beam steering loss computation.

.. command:: electronic_beam_steering_limit <angle-value>

   Specifies the angular limit that the electronic_beam_steering_loss_exponent will be applied.

.. command:: scan_mode [ fixed | azimuth | elevation | both | azimuth_and_elevation]

   Indicates how the subsystem scans in respect to the current cue:

   * **fixed** - The subsystem does not move. This is the default.
   * **azimuth** - The subsystem scans only in azimuth.
   * **elevation** - The subsystem scans only in elevation.
   * **both** or **azimuth_and_elevation** - The subsystem scans in both azimuth and elevation.

   **Default** **fixed**

.. command:: scan_stabilization [ none | pitch | roll | pitch_and_roll ]

   Specify if the scan volume (defined by the azimuth_scan_limits_ and elevation_scan_limits_) are
   'stabilized' to counter the effects of platform pitch and roll.

   **Default** none

.. command:: azimuth_scan_limits <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Specify the minimum and maximum angle about which the subsystem can scan in azimuth.  These values are applicable only
   if scan_mode_ is azimuth or both.  The limits are with respect to the current cue.

   **Default** -180.0 degrees to 180 degrees

.. command:: elevation_scan_limits <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Specify the minimum and maximum angle about which the subsystem can be scan in elevation.  These values are applicable
   only if scan_mode_ is elevation or both. The limits are with respect to the current cue.

   **Default** -90.0 degrees to 90 degrees

.. command:: azimuth_field_of_view <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Specify the minimum and maximum angle about which the subsystem can see in azimuth.  The limits are with respect to the
   current cue.  In general these values should be greater than or equal to the azimuth_scan_limits_ (possibly
   accounting for the width of the beam when the subsystem is positioned to its scan limit).

   **Default** -180.0 degrees to 180 degrees

   .. note::
      If scan_stabilization_ is enabled, the 'field of view' volume will be stabilized in the same way
      the scan volume is stabilized.

   .. note::
      These values are used only for initial screening to determine if the object can potentially interact with another
      object.

.. command:: elevation_field_of_view <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Specifies the minimum and maximum angle about which the subsystem can see in elevation.  The limits are with respect to
   the current cue.  In general these values should be greater than or equal to the elevation_scan_limits_ (possibly
   accounting for the width of the beam when the subsystem is positioned to its scan limit).

   **Default** -90.0 degrees to 90 degrees

   .. note::
      If scan_stabilization_ is enabled, the 'field of view' volume will be stabilized in the same way
      the scan volume is stabilized.

   .. note::
      These values are used only for initial screening to determine if the subsystem can potentially
      interact with another object.

.. command:: field_of_view ... end_field_of_view

   Specifies geometrical limits to determine if a subsystem can potentially interact with another object. Field of views are valid for anything that uses an electromagnetic antenna, including transmitter, receiver, and radar beams.

         ... :ref:`Type Commands <field_of_view_commands>` ...
      end_field_of_view

   :ref:`<field-of-view-type> <field_of_view_commands>` specify the types of field of views defined and their associated commands. Available types are:

   .. include:: field_of_view_types.txt
   
   .. note::
      If :command:`_.antenna_commands.scan_stabilization` is enabled, the 'field of view' volume will be stabilized in the same way the scan volume is stabilized.

   .. note::
      A :ref:`field_of_view_commands.rectangular` field of view is provided by default.  It can then be configured directly using the :command:`field_of_view.rectangular.azimuth_field_of_view` and :command:`field_of_view.rectangular.elevation_field_of_view` keywords.
