.. command:: clock_rate <time-value>

   Specify the number of simulation seconds for each second of wall clock time for a `real-time <realtime>`_ simulation.

   **Default:** 1.0 seconds (1 simulation second for each wall clock second.)

.. command:: delta_universal_time <time-value>

   Specify the difference between universal time (UT1, defined by the earth's rotation), and Coordinated Universal Time
   (UTC, defined with a fixed offset to atomic clocks).

   **Default:** 0.0 second

   .. note:: By convention, the absolute value of delta_universal_time_ should not exceed 0.9 seconds.

.. command:: delta_atomic_time <positive-integer>

   Specify the fixed offset in integer seconds between atomic time (TAI) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
   This is equivalent to the cumulative number of leap seconds inserted into the calendar until the start_epoch_.

   **Default:** 32

.. command:: end_time <time-value>

   Specify the end time of the simulation.

   **Default:** 1 minute

.. command:: enumerate <list-name> to [ <filename> | STDOUT ]

   This command 'enumerates' (or lists) the registered type names of the specified list to the indicated file.
   *<list-name>* must be one of **platform_types**, **sensor_types**, **processor_types**,
   **comm_types** or **dictionary**. The format of the resulting file is a header line identifying the list followed by
   one line for each type where the line contains a unique number that represents the string followed by the actual
   string, enclosed in single quotes.

   This is mostly useful for interfacing with other simulations that may need to know the names of the various types of
   objects and perhaps the internal numeric value that is equivalent to the string.

   .. note::

      In order to be effective, these commands should typically occur as the last commands in the input
      stream.

.. command:: frame_rate <frequency-value>

   Specify the frame rate for the frame-stepped simulation executive. Either this command or frame_time_ can be used
   to define the length of time allocated for each frame.

   .. note::
     This command is only valid when used in conjunction with frame-stepped simulations (e.g., Using
     mission -rt).  Use of this command with event-stepped simulations is invalid and will generate an input error.

   **Default:** 4 hz

.. command:: frame_time <time-value>

   Specify the frame time for the frame-stepped simulation executive.  Either this command or frame_rate_ can be
   used to define the length of time allocated for each frame.

   .. note::
      This command is only valid when used in conjunction with frame-stepped simulations (e.g., Using
      mission -rt).  Use of this command with event-stepped simulations is invalid and will generate an input error.

   **Default:** 250 ms

.. command:: minimum_mover_timestep <time-value>

   This is applicable only for event-stepped simulations. The value specifies the minimum amount of time that must elapse
   between two successive position updates for a given platform. During the course of a simulation, requests are made to
   platforms to update their position to the current simulation time. A position update for a given platform will be
   ignored if the elapsed time since the last position update is less than the value specified by this command.

   A value greater than zero represents a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. The default value of
   0.050 seconds for real-time simulations is representative of the typical 20 Hertz update rate found in many real-time
   simulations.

   **Default:** 0 seconds for non-real-time simulations and 0.050 seconds (20 Hz) for real-time simulations.

.. command:: on_platform_injection (\ :class:`WsfPlatform` aPlatform) ... end_script

   Defines a script allowing the user to prevent or delay the injection of a platform.  This script is executed prior to
   adding any platform to the simulation.  **true** should be returned to continue adding the platform normally.
   **false** should be returned to prevent the platform from being injected.  :method:`WsfPlatform.SetCreationTime` may be
   used in this script to delay the creation of the platform.

.. command:: platform_availability

   .. parsed-literal::

    platform_availability

       // Probabilistic constraints

       name *<platform-name>* availability *<probability-of-being-available>*
       type *<platform-type>* availability *<probability-of-being-available>*
       category *<category-name>* availability *<probability-of-being-available>*
       default availability *<probability-of-being-available>*

       // Geographic constraints

       exclusion_zone *<zone-name>*
       inclusion_zone *<zone-name>*
    end_platform_availability

   This command is used to specify the availability of platforms when added during simulation initialization (i.e., it
   does not apply to platforms added after simulation initialization). One can define probabilistic constraints based on
   platform name or type or can define geographic constraints based on exclusion or inclusion within :command:`zones <zone>`.

   Probabilistic constraints define the probability that a specifically named platform, all platforms of a specific type
   or platforms that are members of selected categories are eligible to be added to the simulation.  A
   *<probability-of-being-available>* of 0 indicates the platform will not be added to the simulation while a value of 1
   indicates the platform will be eligible to be added to the simulation, subject to the geographic constraints described
   below.  For intermediate values, a uniform random number in the range (0, 1) will be drawn. If the random number is
   greater than the *<probability-of-being-available>*, the platform will not be added to the simulation.

   The determination of the *<probability-of-being-available>* value for a given platform is determined using the
   following rules. Once a value has been determined, all subsequent rules are skipped.

   #. If the name of the platform matches any **name** entry, use the *<probability-of-being-available>* from that entry.
   #. For each type in a platform's type-hierarchy (in newest-to-oldest order), if the type matches any **type** entry, use
      the *<probability-of-being-available>* from that entry.
   #. For each category of which the platform is a member (in first-to-last order), if the category matches any
      **category** entry, use the *<probability-of-being-available>* from that entry.
   #. Use the *<probability-of-being-available>* from the **Default:** entry if it has been defined.
   #. Use the default value of 1.0.

   Once a platform has been selected by the probabilistic constraints, geographic constraints are applied. Geographic
   constraints are implemented using the **exclusion_zone** and **inclusion_zone** commands. If one or more
   **exclusion_zone** commands are present, a platform will not be added to the simulation if its initial location is
   within any of the specified zones. If one or more **inclusion_zone** commands are present, a platform will be added to
   the simulation only if its initial location is within one of the specified zones. Note that if geographic constraints
   are used, only one form or the other (exclusion or inclusion) can be used.

   .. note::
      Geographic constraints are not applied to space platforms.


.. command:: quantitative_track_quality <boolean-value>

   Specify whether track quality is to be computed based on quantitative simulation parameters, such as sensor measurement
   errors and target behavior models.  If disabled, only the input :command:`sensor_mode.track_quality` information is
   used, and for a given sensor's tracks, it generally does not change during the course of the simulation.

   **Default:** *disabled*

.. command:: random_seed <positive-integer>

   Specify the random seed for the simulation. This command should typically be used when you want to run a single
   iteration with a particular random seed.  For running multiple runs within a single execution of the program, consider
   the use of the :command:`generate_random_seeds` command documented in :ref:`Monte_Carlo_Iteration`
   or the random_seeds_ defined below.

.. command:: random_seeds

   .. parsed-literal::

    random_seeds
      *<random-seed-1>*
      ...
      *<random-seed-n>*
    end_random_seeds

   Specifies the random seeds for each run of :ref:`Monte_Carlo_Iteration` collection of runs. This command
   implicitly defines :command:`initial_run_number` to be 1 and :command:`final_run_number`
   to the number of seeds entered. The values of :command:`initial_run_number` and
   :command:`final_run_number` may be subsequently redefined and will be limited by the number of
   entries in the list. If an empty list is provided then only a single iteration will be run using the random seed
   defined by random_seed_ (or the default random seed if not specified).

.. command:: random_seed_time

   Use the clock to set the random seed for this run.   This command should typically be used when you want to run a
   single iteration where the seed is not determined beforehand.

.. command:: randomize_radar_frequencies <boolean-value>

   Forces the initial frequency to use at simulation startup to be chosen randomly for :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` sensor types
   with :model:`alternate_frequency <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`,
   :model:`frequency_channels <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` or :model:`frequency_list <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`
   defined.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: realtime
             non-realtime

   Specify if the simulation is to run in real-time or non-real-time mode.

   If **realtime** is selected, the simulation clock will advance in step with the real time (i.e., wall clock time).
   clock_rate_ command can be used to specify the rate at which time the simulation clock moves relative to the wall
   clock.

   If **non-realtime** is selected, the simulation clock will advance as fast as possible using the time-advancement
   scheme of the underlying simulation. For event-stepped simulations, time will advance when events are dispatched. For
   frame-stepped simulations, time will advance upon frame completion.

   **Default:** **non-realtime** for event-stepped simulations and **realtime** for frame-stepped simulations.

.. command:: timing_method <method>

   Set the underlying timing method used when running real time.
   <method> may be **Default:**, **performance_counter**, **system_time**, or **tick_count**.

   These correspond to an operating system call WSF uses to keep track of time.  These are currently silently ignored on
   non-Windows operating systems.

   On Windows, **Default:** is equivalent to **performance_counter**.

.. command:: simulation_name <string>
   
   Specify a name to identify the simulation within Warlock and Mystic.

.. command:: start_date <month> <day-of-month> <year>

   Specify the date that corresponds to the start of the simulation clock.

   .. note::
      Either this command, along with start_time_ start_time_now_, or start_epoch_, should
      be specified when using satellite objects.

   .. note::
      The month is expressed in a three-character format as follows:

      jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec

      **Default:** jun 1 2003

.. command:: start_time <hh:mm:ss>

   Specify the time of day, referenced to UT midnight and using a 24-hour clock, that corresponds to the start of the
   simulation clock.

   .. note::
      Either this command, along with start_date_, or start_epoch_, should be specified when
      using satellite objects

   **Default:** 12:00:00

.. command:: start_time_now

   Specify that the simulation start time will be synchronized to the system clock time.

   .. note::
      This feature is useful primarily for real-time simulations.

.. command:: start_epoch <epoch-value>

   Specify the epoch that corresponds to the start of the simulation clock.

   .. note::
      Either this command, start_time_now_, or start_date_ and start_time_ should be
      specified when using satellite objects.

   **Default:** 2003152.5

.. command:: use_constant_required_pd <boolean-value>

   This command is applicable only to sensors which implement probabilistic detectors (e.g., the optional Marcum-Swerling
   detection in :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`). For each detection attempt, the simulation will determine the required probability
   of detection (required Pd) that is necessary to declare a successful detection. If the value of this command is
   **false** (the default), the required Pd will be determined randomly. If the value is **true** then the required Pd
   will be the value of the :command:`sensor_mode.required_pd` from the definition in the sensor mode (default of 0.5).

   The command provides the ability to easily switch between probabilistic and non-probabilistic detection behavior.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: use_default_radar_frequencies <boolean-value>

   Force the use of the :command:`_.transmitter.frequency` for :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` with
   :model:`alternate_frequency <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`,
   :model:`frequency_channels <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>` or :model:`frequency_list <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR>`
   defined instead of selecting from these lists.

   **Default:** false

Multi-Threading Commands
========================

This capability allows the user to enable multi-threading behavior in event-stepped or framed-stepped simulations.
Currently, only mover and sensor updates take advantage of this capability.  The simulation uses a thread pool, sized
based on user input, to perform updates on movers and sensors identified as thread safe.  Non thread-safe mover updates
continue to be performed by the main thread.  This feature, used in conjunction with DIS interface and LOS manager
interface multi-threading, can improve performance of large frame-step simulations.  For small simulations, the use of
multi-threading will cause longer run (wall clock) times.

.. note::

   This capability is best used in simulations involving many sensor interactions that is
   being run in with the realtime_ command/mode.

.. command:: multi_thread

   This is an alias for 'multi_threading_ on'.

.. command:: multi_threading <boolean-value>

   Specifies whether to use multi-threading capabilities or not in an event-stepped or framed-step simulation. See the
   `Multi-Threading Commands`_ opening message in this section for more information on multi-threading capabilities.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: number_of_threads <positive-integer>

   Specify the number of worker threads when multi-threading is enabled.

   **Default:** 4

.. command:: multi_thread_update_interval <time-value>

   Specify the multi-threading update time for the event-stepped simulation executive. Either this command or
   multi_thread_update_rate_ can be used to define the length of time allocated for each threading update cycle.
   This time is multiplied by a base rate for the individual platform and sensor updates via the
   platform_update_multiplier_ and sensor_update_multiplier_, respectively.

   .. note::
      This command is only valid when used in conjunction with event-stepped simulations.  Use of this
      command with frame-stepped simulations is invalid and will generate an input error.

   **Default:** 1.0 seconds

.. command:: multi_thread_update_rate <frequency-value>

   Specify the multi-threading update rate for the event-stepped simulation executive. Either this command or
   multi_thread_update_interval_ can be used to define the length of time allocated for each threading update cycle.
   This time is divided by a base rate for the individual platform and sensor updates via the
   platform_update_multiplier_ and sensor_update_multiplier_, respectively.

   .. note::
      This command is only valid when used in conjunction with event-stepped simulations. Use of this
      command with frame-stepped simulations is invalid and will generate an input error.

   **Default:** 1.0 Hz

.. command:: platform_update_multiplier <positive-integer>

   Specify the platform update time multiplier in an event-stepped simulation executive that is multi-threaded. This
   multiplier effectively increases the multi_thread_update_interval_ in which thread updates are performed on the
   platforms by integer values.

   .. note::
      This command is only valid when used in conjunction with event-stepped simulations.  Use of this
      command with frame-stepped simulations is invalid and will generate an input error.

   **Default:** 1

.. command:: sensor_update_multiplier <positive-integer>

   Specify the sensor update time multiplier in a event-stepped simulation executive that is multi-threaded. This
   multiplier effectively increases the multi_thread_update_interval_ in which thread updates are performed on the
   sensors by integer values.

   .. note::
      This command is only valid when used in conjunction with event-stepped simulations.  Use of this
      command with frame-stepped simulations is invalid and will generate an input error.

   **Default:** 1

.. command:: sensor_update_break_time <time-value>

   Specify the sensor thread update break time in a realtime_ executive that is multi-threaded. This time will
   cause the sensor updates to end when the thread runtime is equal to or greater than this value.

   .. note::
      This command is only valid when used in conjunction with real-time simulations.

   **Default:** 0.5 seconds

.. command:: process_priority <string>

   Specify the Windows OS process priority for realtime_ operation of simulation.

   Valid Values { low | normal | above_normal | high | realtime }

   .. warning::
      Setting above normal may cause some modern processors to momentarily freeze or hang.

   **Default:** normal
