Overview
========

:model:`WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR` provides the ability to control the flow of received messages by applying user-defined time
delays and routing. The user provides **process** blocks which specifies the messages to which the accompanying message
delays and routing are applied.

Input Requirements
******************

Input to the processor consists of the following:

* Zero or more **process** blocks which contain:

   * One or more **select** blocks that define the messages to be acted upon.
   * Commands that define the actions to be applied to the selected messages (e.g., `time delay, routing or ignoring <Message Processing Commands_>`_).

* An optional **default_process** block that defines the actions to be applied to messages that are not selected by a
  **process** block.

* An optional **default_routing** block that defines the routing to be applied to messages that do not contain any
  routing commands.

* Commands to configure the queue manager that is responsible for processing messages with a non-zero delay_time_.

Processing Flow
***************

The general flow of processing a received message is as follows:

* Search the **process** blocks for the first entry that applies. If an applicable **process** block is not found, use
  the default message handling as defined by the **default_process** block.
* If the message handling specified ignore_message_, simply ignore the message and exit.
* If the message handling specified a non-zero delay_time_, put the message in the processing queue according to
  the queuing_method_ and number_of_servers_.
* When any necessary delay has been completed (or immediately if no delay was selected), route the message as required:

   * Use the internal and external link commands from the selected **process** or **default_process** block, if defined.
   * If not defined, use the internal and external link commands from the **default_routing** block.

.. block:: WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR

Message Queuing Commands
========================

These commands define the how messages are queued if they require a time_delay.

.. command:: queuing_method [ first_in_first_out | last_in_first_out | none ]

   Specifies how incoming messages are to be queued if all of the servers are busy. A value of **none** indicates the
   message will be discarded if no server is available.

   Default: first_in_first_out

.. command:: number_of_servers [ <integer-reference> | infinite ]

   Specifies the maximum number of messages that can be 'in process' at any given instant of time. If a new message is
   received and all the servers are busy, the message will be queued according to the queuing_method_

   If 'infinite' is specified (the default), received messages are simply delayed by the required amount before being
   forwarded.

   Default: infinite

Message Selection Commands
==========================

The message selection commands occur inside **select** blocks and specify what messages are to be acted upon by the
`Message Processing Commands`_ in the **process** block in which they occur. A message will be selected for
processing if *all* of the selection criteria specified in any **select** block within the **process** block are
true.

Note that with the exception of the sender_ command, each of the selection criteria commands should occur at most
once within a given **select** block. For example, if one desires to select two different types of messages then two
**select** blocks must be provided, each with a different type_ selector.

.. command:: type <message-type>

   Returns true if the supplied message type matches the type from the message. Standard message types are as follows:

   .. include:: message_types.txt

.. command:: subtype <message-subtype>

   Returns true if the supplied message subtype matches the type from the message.

.. command:: sensor_name <sensor-name>

   Returns true if the message is a WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE, WSF_IMAGE_MESSAGE or WSF_VIDEO_MESSAGE, and if the supplied sensor
   name matches the sensor name from the message.

.. command:: sensor_type <sensor-type>

   Returns true if the message is a WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE, WSF_IMAGE_MESSAGE or WSF_VIDEO_MESSAGE, and if the supplied sensor
   type matches the sensor type from the message.

.. command:: sensor_mode <sensor-mode>

   Returns true if the message is a WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE, WSF_IMAGE_MESSAGE or WSF_VIDEO_MESSAGE, and if the supplied sensor
   mode matches the sensor mode from the message.

.. command:: system_name <system-name>

   Returns true if the message is a WSF_STATUS_MESSAGE and if the supplied system name matches the system name from the
   message.

.. command:: sender commander | peer | subordinate | self

   Returns true if the sender of the message was one of the identified platforms.

   .. note::

      This command may be repeated to build the set of acceptable senders. The return value will be true if
      any of the sender commands returns true.

.. command:: script ... script commands ... end_script

   Defines a script that returns true if the message is to be selected. The script variable MESSAGE refers to the current
   message.

Message Processing Commands
===========================

.. command:: delay_time <random-time-reference>

   Specifies the amount of time the message should be delayed before being processed,

   Default: delay_time 0 sec (no delay)

   .. note::

      This is a <random-time-reference>, and as such can specify a distribution from which the delay is
      'drawn' for each received message.

.. command:: ignore_message

   Indicates the message should be ignored.

   Default: false (The message will be processed)

.. command:: script ... script commands ... end_script

   Defines a script that will be called to 'process' the message. The script variable MESSAGE refers to the current
   message.

   This is similar to the **script** block inside of an :command:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.on_message` block in
   :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`.

   .. note::

      This form of the **script** command (no return type, name and argument list) is allowed only within a
      **process** or **default_process** block. The **script** command that occurs outside of these blocks is treated as a
      normal script definition and must include a return type, name and argument list.

External Link Commands
**********************

These commands are used to specify the routing of messages to offboard recipients (i.e., other platforms).

:ref:`External_Link_Commands`

Internal Link Commands
**********************

These commands are used the specify the routing of messages to on 'onboard' recipients (i.e., processors on the same
platform).
