Overview
========

callback provides a mechanism to trigger one or more scripts when a platform reaches a waypoint. The script that the callback triggers can be executed in the context of the platform itself or one of its script processors.

Commands
========

.. command:: execute <name> [in <processor-name>]

   Specify the script that the callback should call when it is triggered. As an optional parameter you can specify a processor that the callback should execute in. To trigger more than one script when the callback occurs, simply include multiple **execute** statements. To add a callback to a waypoint, see the :command:`route.execute` command of the :command:`route` and the :class:`AddCallbackToWaypoint <WsfRoute>` script method.
