Overview
========

:model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR` is a processor that allows the user to provide scripts that can be executed whenever the
processor receives a message or is called for a periodic update. In addition, it allows the definition of
:ref:`external links <External_Link_Commands>` to route messages to other platforms.  Besides the regular "on_update"
script block on the processor, users can use :command:`behavior_tree` and `Finite State Machine Commands`_ on the
script processor to help them organize their script.  The order of operation of a script processor each update is:

#. on_update script block
#. :command:`behavior_tree` on the processor.
#. finite state machine evaluates the current state.

.. block:: WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR

Commands
========

.. command:: on_initialize

   .. parsed-literal::

      on_initialize_
         ...script definition...
      end_on_initialize

   This block defines a script that is executed during 'phase 1' initialization of the processor. During phase 1
   initialization the processor may not assume anything about state of platform or any of its constituent parts.

   The following script variables are predefined:

   .. parsed-literal::

      double       TIME_NOW;          // The current simulation time
      :class:`WsfMessage`   MESSAGE;           // The received message
      :class:`WsfPlatform`  PLATFORM;          // The platform containing this processor
      :class:`WsfProcessor` PROCESSOR;         // This processor (the use of "this" has been deprecated)

.. command:: on_initialize2

    .. parsed-literal::

       on_initialize2
        ...script definition...
       end_on_initialize2

    This block defines a script that is executed during 'phase 2' initialization of the processor. During phase 2
    initialization the processor may assume the platform and its constituent parts have completed phase 1 initialization.

    The following script variables are predefined:

    .. parsed-literal::

       double       TIME_NOW;          // The current simulation time
       :class:`WsfMessage`   MESSAGE;           // The received message
       :class:`WsfPlatform`  PLATFORM;          // The platform containing this processor
       :class:`WsfProcessor` PROCESSOR;         // This processor (the use of "this" has been deprecated)

.. command:: update_interval <time-value>

   Specify the interval at which the on_update_ script should be executed. If this value is not specified then the
   on_update_ script will not be executed (even if it is defined).

   Default: 0.0 secs

.. command:: on_update

    .. parsed-literal::

       on_update
          ...script definition...
       end_on_update

   This block defines a script that is executed in response to the processors periodic update (as defined by the
   update_interval_).  If update_interval_ is not defined or is zero then this block will not be executed.

   The following script variables are predefined:

   .. parsed-literal::

      double       TIME_NOW;          // The current simulation time
      :class:`WsfPlatform`  PLATFORM;          // The platform containing this processor
      :class:`WsfProcessor` PROCESSOR;         // This processor (the use of "this" has been deprecated)

.. command:: on_message

    .. parsed-literal::

        on_message
           [type <message-type> [subtype <message-subtype>] ]
           [default]
              :command:`_.script_commands.script`
                 ...script definition...
              end_script
           ...
        end_on_message

   This command block defines a script that is executed whenever the processor receives a message.  If the **script**
   block is preceded by a **type** / **subtype** commands, the script will process any messages matching the type/subtype.
   If the **script** block is preceded by **default**, it will process the any message type not yet processed in this
   block.

   **type** can be any of the following:

   .. include:: message_types.txt

   The following script variables are predefined:

   .. parsed-literal::

      double       TIME_NOW;          // The current simulation time
      :class:`WsfMessage`   MESSAGE;           // The received message
      :class:`WsfPlatform`  PLATFORM;          // The platform containing this processor
      :class:`WsfProcessor` PROCESSOR;         // This processor (the use of "this" has been deprecated)

   Example

   ::

      on_message
         type WSF_TRACK_MESSAGE
            script
               WsfTrackMessage trackMsg = (WsfTrackMessage)MESSAGE;
               writeln("T=", TIME_NOW, " Received track: ", trackMsg.Track().TrackId().ToString());
            end_script
         default
            script
               writeln("T=", TIME_NOW, " Received other message");
            end_script
      end_on_message

   .. note::

      WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR will forward the message to any links after on_message executes.  Use
      :method:`WsfProcessor.SuppressMessage`\ () to prevents this behavior.

.. _WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR.Finite-State-Machine-Commands:

Finite State Machine Commands
=============================

.. command:: show_state_evaluations

   Indicates that information about state evaluations should be written to standard output. This essentially shows the
   true or false status of the evaluation of each next_state block.

.. command:: show_state_transitions

   Indicates that information about state transitions should be written to standard output.

.. command:: state <state-name>

   Defines a state in a state machine with the name <state-name>.  Each state can use a different :command:`behavior_tree`.
   Each state can have child states defined inside of it.

   .. parsed-literal::

    state <state-name>
      on_entry
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_on_entry
      on_exit
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_on_exit
      next_state <next-state-name-1>
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_next_state
      next_state <next-state-name-n>
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_next_state
      behavior_tree
         ... :command:`behavior_tree` Commands ...
      end_behavior_tree
      state <child-state-name-1>
         ...
      end_state
      state <child-state-name-N>
         ...
      end_state
    end_state

Script Interface
================

All of the methods defined in :class:`WsfProcessor` (and by derivation those in :class:`WsfPlatformPart` and :class:`WsfObject`) are available to any of the scripts defined within this processor.

.. command:: on_message_create

   .. parsed-literal::
   
      script void on_message_create(:class:`WsfMessage` aMessage) ... end_script

   This is an optional script that can be defined, which allows one to modify a message internally created by a processor
   prior to it being sent. This is typically used to override the default priority of a message using
   :method:`WsfMessage.SetPriority`

   .. note::

       This script is currently invoked ONLY by :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR` prior to sending a
       :class:`WsfTrackMessage` or a :class:`WsfTrackDropMessage` to external recipients. Other processors will be modified in the
       future to invoke this script if it is defined.
