Platform Part Commands
----------------------

Overview
========

This defines the commands that are common to 'platform parts':

.. include:: platform_parts.txt

Commands
========

.. block:: _.platform_part

.. command:: automatic_recovery_time <time-value>

   Define the time elapsed between damage state 1.0 (complete damage) and queued recovery.  Only valid if the time is set
   to a positive value, and part is declared restorable_.  After time elapses, the Resurrect() virtual method
   will be called on the part.

   Default: Zero (not used)

.. command:: aux_data ... aux_data_commands ... end_aux_data

   Define auxiliary data for the object. See the :command:`_.aux_data` command for the syntax of defining auxiliary data.

.. command:: category <name>

   Declare that the object is a member of the specified category. This command may be specified multiple times to indicate
   the object is a member of multiple categories. Categories can be queried by the script language method
   :method:`CategoryMemberOf("*name*") <WsfPlatformPart.CategoryMemberOf>` of :class:`WsfPlatformPart`.

.. command:: clear_categories

   Has the effect of canceling any previous category_ commands.

.. command:: critical
.. command:: non_critical

   If critical, and the part damage becomes 1.0 (broken), the platform will be removed from the simulation.

   Default: non-critical

.. command:: damage_factor <unit-value>

   Initial damage factor of the part.  Zero is no damage, 1.0 is totally damaged (functionally broken).  If damage factor is
   1.0, it must be decreased toward zero before the part can become operational, but non_resurrectible will preclude this.
   External entities or effects may influence the damage level.  It is up to the part implementation to determine how its
   operations are degraded in response to a non-zero damage factor.

   Default: 0.0

.. include:: internallinkcommands.txt

.. command:: debug
.. command:: no_debug

   Enables or disables debugging for the object. The actual effect of enabling debugging for an object is
   implementation-specific. Typically a lot of information will be written to standard output, to allow some control of
   the information displayed use debug_level_.

   Default: no_debug

.. command:: debug_level <level>

   Specifies the debugging level from level [1, 3]. Each level normally provides for different types or quantity of
   debugging information to displayed standard output. Also requires that the debug_ be set. The actual effect of
   enabling debugging level for an object is implementation-specific.

   Default: 3

.. command:: group_join <group-name>
.. command:: group_leave <group-name>

   Adds or removes the platform from the specified :command:`group`.

.. command:: is_a_type_of <type-name>

   The type hierarchy of an object is normally defined by the objects from which the object inherits. This command allows
   one to define that the object is also of the specified type.

.. command:: broken

   Part is declared non_operational, completely damaged, and non_resurrectible.  Is functionally equivalent to setting the
   damage_factor_ to 1.0, non_restorable_, and non_operational_ simultaneously.  The part cannot be
   repaired.

   Default: functional

.. command:: off
.. command:: on

   Define the initial state of the object to be off or on.

   Default: Depends on the type of object. Typically 'on', but 'off' for sensors.

.. command:: operational
.. command:: non_operational

   Define the operational state of the object. An object that is operational can be turned off and on and otherwise used
   for operations. An object that is non_operational cannot be used until it is made operational.

   Default: operational

.. command:: restorable
.. command:: non_restorable

   Define the ability of the part to recover from damage factor = 1.0.  If non_restorable, the part damage latches at
   1.0.

   Default: restorable
