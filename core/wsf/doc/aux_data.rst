Overview
========

aux_data provides a mechanism to attach application-specific data to :command:`track`, :command:`platform`, :command:`comm`,
:command:`sensor`, :command:`_.transmitter` and :command:`_.receiver` objects. The data can be manipulated using script methods or
from application-specific code.

Simple Attributes
=================

The simple attribute types, bool, int, double, and string, correspond with their C-code equivalents.  The unitary type
allows users to specify a double value using units.  An example of an aux_data definition with only simple data types
is the following:

.. parsed-literal::

   aux_data_
      bool    IS_DETECTED          = false
      string  FAC_RESPONSE         = "FLY_ROUTE"
   end_aux_data

Initial values may be provided as shown in the example above.  If initial values are omitted they are assigned default
values as follows::

 bool    : false
 int     : 0
 double  : 0.0
 string  : ""

Unitary Types
=============

A unitary type represents a variable with WSF standard units.  In order to provide a unitary
declaration within an aux_data block, one must provide the unit type as well as an initial value.  An example of a
unitary declaration is the following:

 unitary TIME_DETECTED = 1.0 seconds

Including this declaration in the above example yields the following:

.. parsed-literal::

   aux_data_
      bool    IS_DETECTED    = false
      unitary TIME_DETECTED  = 1.0 seconds
      string  FAC_RESPONSE   = "FLY_ROUTE"
   end_aux_data

Structures
==========

Structures are used to group associated variables together, these are defined in aux data using the 
``struct`` keyword; for example::

 struct TARGET_INFO_TYPE
    string NATIONALITY = "USA"
    int    TAIL_NUMBER = 4321
    string ENGINE_TYPE = "GE-111"
 end_struct
 
.. note::
   These structures are intended as a method to provide additional data to scenarios in an unobtrusive 
   way that can be accessed/modified from the codebase, especially in terms of usage for external plugins and extensions.
   These structures are fundamentally different than :class:`script_struct`, therefore a :class:`script_struct`
   is not available to be used in aux_data. 

Structures declared in aux data are not accessible in script, though the struct members may be accessible, for example:

.. parsed-literal::

   aux_data_
      struct example
         int x = 3
      end_struct
   end_aux_data
   execute at_time 1 sec absolute
      int y = PLATFORM.AuxDataInt("x");
      writeln(y); // output is "3"
   end_execute

.. note::
   Structures may be nested inside other structures, but those nested structures' members can not be accessed in script.

These user-defined structures are placed in aux data definitions along with simple attributes as follows:

.. parsed-literal::

   aux_data_
      bool              IS_DETECTED       = false
      unitary           TIME_DETECTED     = 1.0 seconds
      string            FAC_RESPONSE      = "FLY_ROUTE"
      TARGET_INFO_TYPE  TARGET_INFO
   end_aux_data
   
.. note::
   Structures must be a Registered Type in order to be used as a type in aux data, see below.

Registered Types
================

Registered types (formerly, Complex types) are classes and structures already defined in code.  One must register a
registered type in code, with the C++ statement ``UtAttributeBase::RegisterPrototype``, before it may be used in an
aux_data definition.  For example, in order to use the WSF C++ class, ``WsfCategoryList``, as a registered type in an
aux_data declaration, one must first register this type, in code, as follows::

 // Option 1:
 UtAttributeBase::RegisterPrototype("WSF_CATEGORY_LIST",
                                    ut::make_unique<UtAttribute<WsfCategoryList>>());
 // Option 2:
 UtAttribute<WsfCategoryList>::RegisterPrototype("WSF_CATEGORY_LIST");

Adding an attribute of this type to the above aux_data declaration results in the following:

.. parsed-literal::

   aux_data_
      bool              IS_DETECTED       = false
      unitary           TIME_DETECTED     = 1.0 seconds
      string            FAC_RESPONSE      = "FLY_ROUTE"
      TARGET_INFO_TYPE  TARGET_INFO
      WSF_CATEGORY_LIST SENSOR_CATEGORIES
   end_aux_data

.. note::

   There is no initial value for registered types.  The objects' constructors will perform the necessary
   initialization.
