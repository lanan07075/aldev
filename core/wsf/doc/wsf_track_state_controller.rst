Overview
========

:model:`WSF_TRACK_STATE_CONTROLLER` is a facility that allows the user to categorize tracks using the concept of a finite
state machine. The user defines a set of transition rules that define the conditions under which a transition can occur from
one state to another. The transition rules are defined using the :ref:`WSF scripting language <script>`.  Each track
maintains its own state in the machine.

State Machine Commands
======================

.. command:: show_state_evaluations
   
   Indicates that information about state evaluations should be written to standard output. This essentially shows the
   true or false status of the evaluation of each next_state block.

.. command:: show_state_transitions
   
   Indicates that information about state transitions should be written to standard output.

.. command:: state <state-name>
   
   Defines a state in a state machine with the name <state-name>.::

    state <state-name>
      on_entry
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_on_entry
      on_exit
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_on_exit
      next_state <next-state-name-1>
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_next_state
      next_state <next-state-name-n>
         ... <script-commands> ...
      end_next_state
    end_state

Thinker Commands
================

.. command:: number_of_servers
   
   Specifies the maximum number of evaluations that can occur simultaneously. See `Method of Operation`_ below.
   
   Default: 1

Track State Controller Commands
===============================

.. command:: evaluate_candidate_tracks <boolean>
   
   Indicates if 'candidate tracks' are to be evaluated. A candidate track is one that has been received but has not yet
   been determined to be 'stable' as defined by the filter.
   
   Default: false

.. command:: evaluation_interval <state-name> <time-value>
   
   Specifies how often a track in the indicated state should be (re)evaluated.

.. command:: time_to_evaluate <state-name> <time-value>
   
   Specifies how long it takes to perform an evaluation of track in the indicated state. This simulates how long it takes
   to "think' or perform an evaluation in a logical sense.
   
   Default: 0.01 seconds

Script Interface
================

:model:`WSF_TRACK_STATE_CONTROLLER` utilizes the capabilities of the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface` and :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`,
and provides the following additional capabilities:

.. command:: on_track_drop ... end_on_track_drop
.. command:: void on_track_drop ... end_script
   
   This is invoked whenever a processor is informed of a track drop by the track manager. The implicitly defined script
   variable **TRACK** (of type :class:`WsfLocalTrack`) represents the last known state of the track that is being dropped.

Method of Operation
===================

Each track, when it is first discovered, is initially put into the first state as defined in the input file after the
time_to_evaluate_ interval has elapsed. From that point on it will continue to evaluate the transition rules for
whatever state it is currently in and will transition to new states as the rules allow. When a transition occurs, the
on_exit script for the current state will be executed (if it is defined) and the on_entry script for the new state will
be executed (if it is defined). The first time the state is entered the time_to_evaluate_ interval is applied.
This serves as a thinking delay on state entry.

Each track is (re)evaluated at the interval defined by the state in which the track currently exists. The logical time
that it takes to perform the evaluation is defined by the time_to_evaluate for that state. The controller can perform
up to number_of_servers evaluations at a time. When it comes time to evaluate a state for a given track, it is
determined if a server is available to perform the evaluation. If a server is available, it is marked busy for the
time_to_evaluate and will perform the actual rule evaluation at the completion of the interval (thus simulating the
thinking process) and schedule the next evaluation. If a server is not available then it is put on a pending queue for
evaluation by the next server that becomes available.
