Scenarios and Projects
======================

AFSIM **Projects** are a collection of files consisting of one or more scenarios and components (such as platforms, sensors, communications, etc.).

AFSIM **Scenarios** are files consisting of commands and scripts. They define specific platforms to be simulated and platform_types which may be used to dynamically add platforms to a simulation.

* Scenario development and editing can be performed through the Wizard IDE.
* Scenarios may be simulated with Mission and Warlock.
* The result of an executed scenario is a **simulation**.

Quick Start
-----------

.. tip:: The **simple_flight** scenario will be built upon in subsequent topic discussions. It will begin as a simple scenario, and grow in complexity throughout this guide.

New projects are created in Wizard at startup. Project directories and files may be created to organize project components, outputs, and configurations.

Scenarios consist mainly of commands and scripts which manipulate platforms. The following text is an example of a simple scenario:

.. code-block::

   # simple_flight demo

   execute at_time 0.1 sec absolute
      writeln("Simulating simple_flight scenario...");
   end_execute

In this scenario the *execute* command runs the *writeln* script to output "Simulating simple_flight scenario..." in the simulation log and/or console.

   .. note:: Scenarios or projects may be loaded into Wizard. Scenarios can simulated with Mission and Warlock, but projects can only be opened from Wizard.

Create a New Project and Scenario File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To create a new project and add the "simple_flight" scenario perform the following steps:

1. Launch Wizard.
2. From the Wizard Startup window, click the "New..." button on the bottom right.
3. Navigate to the desired working directory.
4. Create a new directory called *Simple Flight*.
5. In the *Simple Flight* folder, create a new project file and save as *simple_flight.afproj*.
6. In the Wizard File menu, click "New File...".
7. Enter *simple_flight.txt* and click "OK".

.. image:: ../images/create_scenario_file.png
   :scale: 80%
   :align: center

8. Wizard will automatically open *simple_flight.txt* for editing.
9. The file will also appear in Wizard's project browser. Right click the file to open its context menu.
10. Select `Set as Startup File`.

.. image:: ../images/set_startup_file.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

This indicates to Wizard that *simple_flight.txt* is a scenario file associated with the simple_flight project.
Scenario files show the Wizard's Purple Hat as the file icon, and the startup file names are underlined.
The number in parentheses after *simple_flight.txt* indicates that this is the first file in the start-up file list for this scenario.
Startup files open automatically when the project is opened. Finally, Wizard provides syntax highlighting only for project files.

.. tip:: If ever you open a file, and expect Wizard to provide syntax highlighting, but none appears, ensure the file is included in the project either as a startup file,
         or as an included file, somewhere within a startup file.

Building a Scenario Startup File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. To get started, type the following code block in *simple_flight.txt*.

   .. code-block::

      # simple_flight demo for AFSIM User Manual

      simulation_name "Simple Flight"

      execute at_time 0.1 sec absolute
         writeln("Simulating simple_flight scenario...");
      end_execute

      end_time 90 sec

2. Save the file.

In order to maintain the scalability of a large project, containing one or more large scenarios, it's important to understand the role of a startup file.
Startup files typically include one or more of the following:

* High level information about the scenario and its purpose
* Definitions to setup various output formats
* Simulation level commands (i.e. Simulation end time settings, or timed script executions, etc.)
* File includes to provide resources to the scenario, including:

  * platform_type definitions
  * platform parts
  * platform laydowns for one or more teams

Run the Scenario From Wizard
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To run the scenario in Mission from Wizard, first ensure that **Mission** is displayed to the left of the Run Button in Wizard's Sim Execution Toolbar  |MISSION_TOOLBAR|.

.. |MISSION_TOOLBAR| image:: ../images/wiz_run_mission_toolbar.png
   :scale: 70%

.. tip:: If "Mission" is not displayed next to the Run Button, click the current name to open Wizard's Sim Execution preferences, then select Mission from the list, and
         click "Apply" to save changes.

Next, click the Run Button, and observe the console output within Wizard's Output widget.

   .. note:: If the Output Widget is not visible. It can be shown by clicking "View" in the Wizard Menu Bar, and checking the "Output" option.

By default, Mission will print metadata to the Output view, including version information, plugins, extensions, and basic runtime statistics.

For this example the message, "Simulating simple_flight scenario..." is also printed, between "Starting simulation." and "Simulation complete".

.. image:: ../images/mission_basic_output_simple_flight.png
   :scale: 60%
   :align: center

Run the Scenario from Mission on Command Line
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To run this scenario from Mission on the command line, open a command line interface and navigate to the *simple_flight* directory.

Next, input the following command:

.. code-block::

   mission simple_flight.txt

Mission will then simulate the scenario, and in this case, print all output directly to the command line, as well as the mission.log.

   .. note:: If Mission does not execute as expected, ensure that the AFSIM installation path is set in the system environment variables.

Review
------

After completing this module, the *simple_flight* project should include a single scenario file, *simple_flight.txt* that reflects the following:

   .. note:: The execution time should be increased to 30 minutes.  This will be necessary as this simulation becomes more advanced in the following modules. 

.. code-block::

   # simple_flight demo

   simulation_name "Simple Flight"

   execute at_time 0.1 sec absolute
      writeln("\nSimulating simple_flight scenario...");
   end_execute

   end_time 30 min

Summary
-------

A project encapsulates one or more scenarios. Scenarios or projects may be opened and modified in Wizard. Mission and Warlock are two AFSIM Suite applications used to simulate scenarios.
