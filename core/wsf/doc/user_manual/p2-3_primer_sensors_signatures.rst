Sensors and Signatures
======================

A **sensor** is a platform part which provides the owning platform the means to detect other platforms and/or their integral parts.

A **signature** is a platform attribute used to determine weather a given sensor is able to detect the signature's owning platform.

Below is a list of platform signature attributes used to detect platforms:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 4

   * Acoustic
   * Infrared
   * Optical
   * Radar

Options are available for signal propagation, extinction, clutter and errors in AFSIM, and sensors support the use of transmitters, receivers, and antennas to provide higher fidelity
modeling and simulation; however, these are advanced topics and are not discussed in detail in this guide.

The following list includes some predefined sensor models:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 4

   * WSF_RADAR_SENSOR
   * WSF_ESM_SENSOR
   * WSF_SAR_SENSOR
   * WSF_IRST_SENSOR

Quick Start
-----------

When modeling aircraft, it is likely that a radar signature is most important for general modeling purposes. With a defined radar signature, an aircraft may be detected by
a radar sensor.

To define a radar signature, add the following signature command block to the scenario file at the global scope (not within a platform, platform type, or other block command).
Naming in this example follows with earlier examples in this guide:

.. code-block::

   radar_signature CARGO_AIRCRAFT_RADAR_SIG
      constant 10 m^2
   end_radar_signature

Then provide this signature attribute to the associated platform type definition:

.. code-block::

   platform_type CARGO_AIRCRAFT WSF_PLATFORM

      ...

      radar_signature CARGO_AIRCRAFT_RADAR_SIG

   end_platform_type

All platforms inheriting this type may now be detected by radar sensors. With that, a simplified radar sensor may be defined by adding the following sensor command block
to an existing platform or platform type definition. Alternatively, the sensor may be defined independently and added to a given platform or platform type as needed.

.. code-block::

   sensor AIR_RADAR WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR
      frame_time 5 sec
      maximum_range 30 nm

      reports_location
      reports_bearing

      on
   end_sensor

.. note:: The `WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR` is used in this example for simplicity, as it is a cross-domain sensor model based purely on geometry.
          To implement a higher fidelity radar, see `WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.

Closer Look
-----------

Sensors vary widely in their capability, but generally, they identify the existence of a platform. Intuitive examples of sensors include human eyes, which may be modeled as
a WSF_OPTICAL_SENSOR or human ears, which may be modeled as a WSF_ACOUSTIC_SENSOR. However, these sensors are of little value if detection targets have undefined detectability.
This is where signatures come in. Signatures define the, "detectability" of a given platform or platform part within the associated domain. The WSF_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE of a building
defines the way light is reflected off of the building, in such a way as it may be detected (or seen) by a WSF_OPTICAL_SENSOR. Similarly, the WSF_ACOUSTIC_SIGNATURE of an
aircraft defines the frequency and the energy (loudness) of the noise created by that aircraft, such that it may detected (or heard) by a WSF_ACOUSTIC_SENSOR. Different sensor/signature
pairs each fall into a domain, describing a platforms detectability, and a sensors ability to detect within the respective domain.

.. note:: The following steps assume that the "simple_flight" scenario is present as discussed in :doc:`p2-2_primer_mover_routes`.

Adding a Radar Signature
""""""""""""""""""""""""

As described in `Quick Start`_, a radar signature may be defined in *simple_flight* by adding the following `radar_signature` command block in the `simple_flight.txt` script:

.. code-block::

   radar_signature CARGO_AIRCRAFT_RADAR_SIG
      constant 10 m^2
   end_radar_signature

.. tip:: This is a simple, spherical radar signature, provided for capability demonstration. More complex/accurate signatures may be defined using other
         commands available within the `radar_signature` command block.

To associate this radar signature with `CARGO_AIRCRAFT` include the following code in the associated platform type definition:

.. code-block::

   radar_signature CARGO_AIRCRAFT_RADAR_SIG

Adding a Radar
""""""""""""""

A radar is a type of sensor, another fundamental platform part critical to AFSIM simulations. Additional sub-commands may be included in the sensor definition which
affect the sensor's properties, including its field of view, the information it reports about a detected entity, and its range. These will be important to prevent a collision
between the two aircraft in the *simple_flight* scenario.

With the addition of a radar, it now becomes important that the two aircraft are assigned to different teams/sides, to ensure expected behavior in upcoming modules.

1. Add the following team colors to the platform definitions of cargo-1 and cargo-2 (This may be completed in Wizard's Platform Details if a platform is selected in the Map Display):

   .. code-block::

      platform cargo-1 CARGO_AIRCRAFT
         ...
         side blue
      end_platform

      platform cargo-2 CARGO_AIRCRAFT
         ...
         side green
      end_platform

2. Next, add the following sensor definition to the `CARGO_AIRCRAFT` platform type definition
   (This may be completed from Platform Browser > Right-Click > Manage Platform Parts if the sensor is defined independently) and save the file:

   .. code-block::

      sensor AIR_RADAR WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR
         frame_time 3 sec
         maximum_range 50 nm

         reports_location
         reports_bearing
         reports_side
         reports_velocity

         azimuth_field_of_view   -45.0 deg  45.0 deg
         elevation_field_of_view -15.0 deg  15.0 deg

         on
      end_sensor

With this addition, the two aircraft will sense (and create tracks for) each other when their distances close to below the `maximum_range` specified for the sensor.

**Warlock's** Map Display should reflect the following at simulation start (Sensor Volumes and Routes visibility may be displayed via Warlock's Platform Options widget):

   :align: center

Review
------

After completing this module, the *simple_flight* project should include a single scenario file, *simple_flight.txt* that reflects the following:

.. code-block::

   # simple_flight demo

   simulation_name "Simple Flight"

   execute at_time 0.1 sec absolute
      writeln("\nSimulating simple_flight scenario...");
   end_execute

   end_time 30 min

   radar_signature CARGO_AIRCRAFT_RADAR_SIG
      constant 10 m^2
   end_radar_signature

   platform_type CARGO_AIRCRAFT WSF_PLATFORM
      icon c130
      spatial_domain air
      category cargo

      mover WSF_AIR_MOVER
         update_interval 3 sec
      end_mover

      radar_signature CARGO_AIRCRAFT_RADAR_SIG

      sensor AIR_RADAR WSF_GEOMETRIC_SENSOR
         frame_time 5 sec
         maximum_range 30 nm

         reports_location

         azimuth_field_of_view   -45.0 deg  45.0 deg
         elevation_field_of_view -15.0 deg  15.0 deg

         ignore_same_side
         on
      end_sensor

   end_platform_type

   platform cargo-1 CARGO_AIRCRAFT
      side blue
      heading 90 deg
      altitude 8000 m

      route
         position 00:30s 01:30w altitude 8000 m speed 500 km/h
         position 00:30s 01:45e
      end_route

   end_platform

   platform cargo-2 CARGO_AIRCRAFT
      side green
      heading -90 deg
      altitude 8000 m

      route
         position 00:30s 01:30e altitude 8000 m speed 500 kmh
         position 00:30s 01:45w
      end_route

   end_platform

.. note:: As the *simple_flight* scenario becomes more complex, reorganization of the project becomes more valuable. Subsequent modules will include separation of the single
          startup file into multiple resource files. Instead of adding code directly to the startup file for upcoming modules, contents will be added to new files or appropriate
          existing resource files.

Summary
-------

A sensor is able to produce tracks for domain specific signatures that it perceives. Signatures define the detectability of a given platform within a given domain. Tracks are key to
the automatic response of a platform in decision making when they are passed to processors for interpretation. Tracks and processors are discussed in upcoming modules.
