Tracks
======

**Tracks** are most often created as a direct result of a sensor detecting a platform. Tracks contain information that describes known(truth),
and perceived information concerning the subject platform, and what sensor created the track.

Quick Start
-----------

.. note:: The following steps assume that the "simple_flight" scenario is present as discussed in :doc:`p2-3_primer_sensors_signatures`.

1. Run the simple_flight scenario in Warlock.
2. Pause the simulation.
3. Advance the simulation time to `15 min` using Warlock's `Advance to Time` button, shown in the Simulation Control toolbar.
4. Your simulation should reflect the following as seen in Warlock's Map Display (Sensor Volumes and Routes visibility may be toggled in Warlock's Platform Options widget):

   .. image:: ../images/simple_flight_at_15_min.png
      :align: center

5. Select one of the two platforms and open Warlock's Platform Part Browser.
6. Resume the simulation.
7. Open the dropdown menu for AIR_RADAR > Tracks.
8. Notice that soon after the approaching platform enters the sensor volume (range) of the selected platform, a track will appear in the `AIR_RADAR`'s track list.
9. Select the other platform, and notice that this is the same for the opposite platform's `AIR_RADAR` track list as well.

Closer Look
-----------

No additional content will be added for this module. The important take away is that the tracks appearing on the AIR_RADAR sensors are what will be acted upon to ensure that the
aircraft do not collide. However, a structural change to the project is necessary for scalability, and is detailed to follow.

In order to keep the *simple_flight* scenario better organized, separate the existing file *simple_flight.txt* into the following:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Revised simple_flight.txt**
     - **platform_laydown.txt**
   
   * - .. code-block::

         # simple_flight demo

         include_once platform_laydown.txt

         simulation_name "Simple Flight"

         execute at_time 0.1 sec absolute
            writeln("\nRun simple_flight\n");
         end_execute

         end_time 30 min

Summary
-------

Tracks, usually generated by sensors, are passed to processors, to affect platform behavior. This is key to understanding why certain events transpire in the way that they do over
the course of a long or complex simulation run where dozens or potentially hundreds of platforms may affect each others behavior. Processors are discussed in an upcoming module.
