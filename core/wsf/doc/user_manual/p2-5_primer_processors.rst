Processors
==========

A **processor** provides the ability to define behaviors for a given platform.

Most processors are defined by the user using the AFSIM scripting language.

The following list includes some predefined processor types:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 4

   * WSF_DIRECTION_FINDER_PROCESSOR
   * WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR
   * WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR
   * WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER
   * WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR
   * WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR

A number of built-in processors are available - each serving a unique function. This guide will demonstrate the implementation of a commonly used model, the `WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`.

Quick Start
-----------

A track processor's primary responsibility is to implement a processor interface for a track_manager. It is responsible for three major functions:

1. Accept reports (tracks) from local and off-board sources
2. Feed reports (tracks) to a track manager for correlation and fusion
3. Send updated tracks to interested parties.

To implement a track processor, include the following code snippet in a platform or platform type definition in the scenario:

.. code-block::

   processor track_proc WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR
      master_track_processor
      purge_interval 10 sec
      report_interval 3 sec
   end_processor

To receive tracks from sensors, the connected sensors must include the following code line in the desired sensor definition:

.. code-block::

   internal_link track_proc

Tracks may also be passed to other platforms through communications and the `external_link` command. Additionally, action may be taken
by an internal task processor that implements behaviors. Behaviors and Communications are discussed in upcoming modules. Before behaviors can be utilized,
a task processor must be defined. Define a task processor (task manager) with the following code:

.. code-block::

   processor TASK_MANAGER WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR
      update_interval 10 sec
   end_processor

Then add an instance of this processor to the desired platform or platform type definition with the following code:

.. code-block::

   add processor task_mgr TASK_MANAGER
   end_processor

.. note:: This will result in the owning platform making decisions and taking action if `TASK_MANAGER` implements a behavior tree.
          Behaviors and Behavior Trees are discussed in upcoming modules.

Closer Look
-----------

.. note:: The following steps assume that the "simple_flight" scenario is present as discussed in :doc:`p2-4_primer_tracks`.

Adding a Track Processor
""""""""""""""""""""""""
In order to do anything with the sensor track created by the `AIR_RADAR`, a track processor must be added to the platform type definition of `CARGO_AIRCRAFT`:

1. Open the *simple_flight* project or scenario in Wizard.
2. Create a new text file, in the *simple_flight* directory and name it, *track_processor.txt*.
3. Open *cargo_aircraft.txt* and add the following code at the beginning of the file:

   .. code-block::

      include_once track_processor.txt

4. Open *track_processor.txt* and add the following track processor command block / definition:

   .. code-block::

      processor TRACK_MANAGER WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR
         master_track_processor
         purge_interval 10 sec
         report_interval 3 sec
      end_processor

5. Return to *cargo_aircraft.txt* and add the following code within the `CARGO_AIRCRAFT` platform type definition:

   .. code-block::

      add processor track_proc TRACK_MANAGER
         purge_interval 15 sec
         report_interval 2.5 sec
      end_processor

   .. tip:: If a value is defined already on an externally defined platform part, as is shown in the example above, values may be overwritten. The override will apply only to the
            platform or platforms of the platform type that have the overwritten implementation.

6. Finally link the `cargo_radar` track report to the `track_proc` by adding the following code line to the radar definition:

   .. code-block::

      internal_link track_proc

7. Having made these additions, simulate the *simple_flight* scenario in Warlock.
8. Advance the simulation to a time just prior to the aircraft entering each other's sensor range (~15 min).
9. In Warlock's Visibility widget, hide one of the teams, and select the aircraft of the visible team.
10. Wait until the hidden platform enters the sensor range of the selected platform.
11. Notice that a track appears, visible only while the platform remains selected. This is a result of the newly added track_manager. The expected view is provided below:

    .. image:: ../images/simple_flight_with_track_proc.png
	   :align: center

The opposing view similarly shows an incoming blue track when the green aircraft is selected.

Now that the tracks are available for processing, and the aircraft are aware of one another, they must resolve the conflict by taking action. This requires the use
of an additional processor, the `WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR`, and the implementation of behaviors. Behaviors and Behavior Trees are discussed in an upcoming module.

Adding a Task Processor
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The task processor will enable "cargo-1" and "cargo-2" the ability to make decisions in order to avoid a collision by implementing behaviors. For this module, the processor
will be implemented so that it is available for use in upcoming modules.

Complete the following steps to implement a task processor:

1. Add the following processor command block to *track_processor.txt*:

   .. code-block::

      processor CARGO_TASK_MANAGER WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR
         update_interval 10 sec
      end_processor

2. Add the following processor implementation block to the platform type definition of `CARGO_AIRCRAFT` in *cargo_aircraft.txt*:

   .. code-block::

      add processor task_mgr CARGO_TASK_MANAGER
      end_processor

This skeleton processor is now ready to implement a behavior tree.

Review
------

After completing this module, the *simple_flight* project should include all previous files and a new file, *track_processor.txt*. Additions/modifications
were made to *cargo_aircraft.txt*. Changes reflect the following:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **track_processor.txt**

Summary
-------

Tracks may be used by processors to determine decisions through behaviors and behavior trees. Processors primarily act on tracks, serving different purposes depending on the
nature of the processor. Tracks may be passed between platform parts of a given platform through the use of the `internal_link` command. More advanced track processing
and decision making may be achieved through implementation of Communications.
