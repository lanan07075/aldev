Overview
========

:model:`WSF_PASSIVE_SENSOR` implements a basic passive RF detection sensor. This can be used to model things like RWR, SIGINT
and ELINT sensors.

The sensor uses two different detection methods to gather data for reporting:

* **Framed** or sampling: The sensor looks at all transmitters within its frequency band whose emission patterns are
  *regular*. This is how the sensor detects search radars. The sample interval for the sensor is specified by the
  :command:`sensor_mode.frame_time` mode command.
* **Unframed**: The sensor uses this method to detect transmitters within its frequency band whose emission patterns
  are *irregular*. This would include tracking radars that employ electronic beam steering to track
  multiple targets, and communications devices that transmit only when a message is being sent.

The sensor combines the results from both detection methods to produce detection reports (:class:`WsfTrack`) for each target
it detects. The detection reports for a given target are produced at intervals defined by the frame_time. Unframed
detections that occur in between frame samples are reported at the next frame sample.

Unframed detections of transient communication signals are reported for each frame sample in which the signal was
present. That is, the transmission of a long message will be detected for the duration of the transmission. Note,
however, that the detection results from the first sample are reported for subsequent samples of the same transmission
(the assumption is being made that very little will change during the duration of transmission).

Commands
========

.. command:: reported_target_type  ... end_reported_target_type
   :block:

   Defines how the passive sensor reports target type information in tracks.

   .. parsed-literal::

      reported_target_type

        ...
        default_type_
           ... type sub-commands ...
      end_reported_target_type


   **Subcommands**

   .. command:: default_time_to_declare <time-value>

      Defines the duration of time after the initial detection that is required to make a determination of the target type.

      Default: 0 sec

   .. command:: default_time_to_reevaluate <time-value>

      Defines the time interval used for reevaluating the identification of the target.  A value of 0 seconds indicates no
      reevaluation will take place.

      Default: 0 sec

   .. command:: type <target_type>

      Specifies the truth type to which the following subcommands apply.

   .. command:: default_type

      Specifies that the following type subcommands apply for any type not defined with the type command.

      **Type SubCommands**

      .. command:: time_to_declare <time-value>

         Defines the duration of time after the initial detection that is required to make a determination of the target type.

         Default: set by the default_time_to_declare command

      .. command:: time_to_reevaluate <time-value>

         Defines the time interval used for reevaluating the identification of the target.

         Default: set using the default_time_to_reevaluate command

      .. command:: report_type <type-name> emitter <emitter-name>

         ::

            report_type <type-name1>
              emitter <emitter-type-1>
              emitter <emitter-type-2>
              ...
              emitter <emitter-name-N>
            report_type <type-type-2
            ...

         Defines the reporting type-name as the target type based on the listed emitter-type(s) being reported in the emitter
         list. Currently exact matches between the emitter's defined for the report_type and a track's emitter list must happen
         for the given report_type to be reported. If there are differences another report_type or the default_type will be
         reported.

      .. command:: report_type <type-name> <probability>

         Defines the probability of reporting type-name as the target type.  The probability parameter is a value between 0.0
         and 1.0.  Any number of report_type commands may be specified as long as the probability parameters add up to 1.0.  For
         greater ease of use, the value remainder may be used as the probability parameter to specify whatever value is required
         to add up to 1.0.

      .. command:: report_truth

         Specifies that the sensor will report the truth type.  This is only valid under the default_type command.

.. block:: WSF_PASSIVE_SENSOR

.. command:: reported_emitter_type  ... end_reported_emitter_type

   Defines how the passive sensor reports emitter type information in tracks.

   .. parsed-literal::

      reported_emitter_type
        default_time_to_declare_ ...
        default_time_to_reevaluate_ ...
        type_ <emitter_type>
           ... type sub-commands ...
        type_ <emitter_type>

      end_reported_emitter_type

   **Subcommands**

   .. command:: default_time_to_declare <time-value>

      Defines the duration of time after the initial detection that is required to make a determination of the emitter type.

      Default: 0 sec

   .. command:: default_time_to_reevaluate <time-value>

      Defines the time interval used for reevaluating the identification of the emitter.  A value of 0 seconds indicates no
      reevaluation will take place.

      Default: 0 sec

   .. command:: type <emitter_type>

      Specifies the truth emitter type to which the following subcommands apply.

   .. command:: default_type

      Specifies that the following type subcommands apply for any type not defined with the type command.

      **Type SubCommands**

      .. command:: time_to_declare <time-value>

         Defines the duration of time after the initial detection that is required to make a determination of the emitter type.

         Default: set by the default_time_to_declare command

      .. command:: time_to_reevaluate <time-value>

         Defines the time interval used for reevaluating the identification of the emitter.

         Default: set using the default_time_to_reevaluate command

      .. command:: report_type <type-name> <probability>

         Defines the probability of reporting type-name as the emitter type.  The probability parameter is a value between 0.0
         and 1.0.  Any number of report_type commands may be specified as long as the probability parameters add up to 1.0.  For
         greater ease of use, the value remainder may be used as the probability parameter to specify whatever value is required
         to add up to 1.0.

      .. command:: report_truth

         Specifies that the sensor will report the truth type.  This is only valid under the default_type command.

.. block:: WSF_PASSIVE_SENSOR

.. command:: unframed_detection_optimization <boolean-value>

   This command indicates if unframed detection optimization will be used. If enabled, once the sensor successfully
   detects a given transmitter within a frame, subsequent attempts to detect the same transmitter in the same frame will
   be suppressed. For instance, if multiple messages are sent from a single transmitter during the passive frame, the passive
   sensor will only report on the first message that it can detect (if any). If the first message cannot be detected
   because of transmitter antenna pointing, it will report the second message if it can be detected, an so on.

   Default: true

   .. note::

      Use this if it is desired to have one ATTEMPT_TO_DETECT :command:`event_output` message for every
      SENSOR_DETECTION_ATTEMPT or MESSAGE_DELIVERY_ATTEMPT message, or if it desired to report the absolute best detection
      within the frame.

.. command:: unframed_detection_coast_time <time-value>

   If the passive sensor is running at a faster frame time than the sensors it is trying to detect, it may detect the
   transmitter one frame and not the next. This can cause a lot of track creation and deletion. This value indicates how
   long a successful detection from a transmitter will be reported.

   Default: 2 seconds

Passive-Specific Mode Commands
==============================

.. command:: frequency_band <lower-frequency> <upper-frequency>

   Defines a band of frequencies this sensor can detect.  This command may be specified more than once if the sensor can
   detect multiple bands.

.. command:: dwell_time <time-value>

.. command:: revisit_time <time-value>

   These two commands pertain to the immediately preceding frequency_band_ and define how long the sensor dwells in
   the band and the interval between dwells. These commands are effectively only when the scan_on_scan_model_ is
   enabled and are used to determine the temporal probability that the sensor would be looking at the frequency of the
   target emitter when a detection chance occurs.

   If these commands are defined for any band in the sensor then they must be defined for all bands in the sensor.

.. command:: continuous_detection_sensitivity <db-power>

.. command:: pulsed_detection_sensitivity <db-power>

.. command:: detection_sensitivity <db-power>

   Defines the minimum signal strength that can be 'reliably' detected. If detection_probability_ is defined then
   this is the signal strength that would result in a Pd of 0.5. If detection_probability_ is not defined then this
   defines the signal strength for which a successful detection will be declared.

   The first two forms set the detection sensitivity for continuous wave and pulsed signals, respectively. The last form
   sets both sensitivities to the same value. If **continuous_detection_sensitivity** is used then
   **pulsed_detection_sensitivity** must also be specified, and vice-versa. If no values for the detection thresholds or
   sensitivities are specified then the detection_threshold_ criteria will be used to set the default value.

   Default: See detection_threshold_.

.. command:: detection_sensitivities ... end_detection_sensitivities
   :block:

   This command allows the definition of frequency-dependent or signal-type- and frequency-dependent detection
   sensitivities.

   To define a table that is only frequency-dependent (for both "continuous" and 'pulsed" signal-types)::

      detection_sensitivities
         frequency <frequency-value-1> <db-power-1>
         frequency <frequency-value-2> <db-power-2>
         frequency <frequency-value-n> <db-power-n>
      end_detection_sensitivities

   To define a table that is signal-type- and frequency-dependent::

      detection_sensitivities
         signal_type <signal-type-1>
            frequency <frequency-value-1> <db-power-1>
            frequency <frequency-value-2> <db-power-2>
            frequency <frequency-value-n> <db-power-n>
         signal_type <signal-type-2>
            frequency <frequency-value-1> <db-power-1>
            frequency <frequency-value-2> <db-power-2>
            frequency <frequency-value-n> <db-power-n>
      end_detection_sensitivities

   **<signal-type>**
      A string input of the signal-type the table is for, valid values are ["continuous" | "pulsed" | "both"].

   **<frequency>**
      A frequency value.

   **<db-power>**
      The received signal strength required for detection at the indicated frequency.

   When defining a signal-type- and frequency-dependent table, the following rule(s) must be noted:

   * Any 'frequency' entry that occurs before the first 'signal_type' entry is assumed to apply to the "both" (i.e.,
     continuous and pulsed) signal-types. If a 'signal_type' is then entered the corresponding data entered before for that
     signal-type will be cleared and the new data entered.

   The process for determining sensitivity uses the following algorithm:

   * If a signal-type-dependent table is being used, the signal-type of the received signal is used to locate the
     appropriate signal-type-specific set of frequency entries.
   * Frequencies greater than or equal *frequency-value-m* and less than *frequency-value-m+1* will use *db-power-m*
   * Frequencies less than *frequency-value-1* will use *db-ratio-1*.
   * Frequencies greater than or equal to *frequency-value-n* will use *db-power-n*.

   .. note::

      Entries will be sorted into increasing order of frequency.

   .. note::

      If detection_threshold_ and/or continuous_detection_threshold_ and/or
      pulsed_detection_threshold_ and/or detection_thresholds_ and/or sensitivity_threshold and/or
      continuous_sensitivities and/or pulsed_sensitivity_threshold and/or detection_sensitivities_ are
      specified, the last one is used.

   .. note::

      If neither detection_threshold_ and/or continuous_detection_threshold_ and/or
      pulsed_detection_threshold_ and/or detection_thresholds_ and/or detection_sensitivity_ and/or
      continuous_detection_sensitivity_ and/or pulsed_detection_sensitivity_ and/or
      detection_sensitivities_ are specified, the detection_threshold will assumed to be 3.0 dB for pulsed and
      continuous signal-types

.. block:: WSF_PASSIVE_SENSOR

.. command:: continuous_detection_threshold <db-ratio>

.. command:: pulsed_detection_threshold <db-ratio>

.. command:: detection_threshold <db-ratio>

   This is an alternative to detection_sensitivity_. It defines the minimum signal-to-noise ratio that can be
   'reliably' detected. If detection_probability_ is defined then this is the signal-to-noise ratio that would
   result in a Pd of 0.5. If detection_probability_ is not defined then this defines the signal-to-noise ratio for
   which a successful detection will be declared.

   The first two forms set the detection threshold for continuous wave and pulsed signals, respectively. The last form
   sets both thresholds to the same value. If **continuous_detection_threshold** is used then
   **pulsed_detection_threshold** must also be specified, and vice-versa. If no values for the detection thresholds or
   sensitivities are specified then both thresholds will be set to 3.0 db to be consistent with old input files.

   Default: 3.0 dB (if both **detection_threshold(s)** and **detection_sensitivity(s)** are not defined)

.. command:: detection_thresholds ... end_detection_thresholds

   This command allows the definition of frequency-dependent or signal-type- and frequency-dependent detection thresholds.

   To define a table that is only frequency-dependent (for both 'continuous' and 'pulsed' signal-types)::

      detection_thresholds
         frequency <frequency-value-1> <db-ratio-1>
         frequency <frequency-value-2> <db-ratio-2>
         frequency <frequency-value-n> <db-ratio-n>
      end_detection_thresholds

   To define a table that is signal-type- and frequency-dependent::

      detection_thresholds
         signal_type <signal-type-1>
            frequency <frequency-value-1> <db-ratio-1>
            frequency <frequency-value-2> <db-ratio-2>
            frequency <frequency-value-n> <db-ratio-n>
         signal_type <signal-type-2>
            frequency <frequency-value-1> <db-ratio-1>
            frequency <frequency-value-2> <db-ratio-2>
            frequency <frequency-value-n> <db-ratio-n>
      end_detection_thresholds

   **<signal-type>**
      A string input of the signal-type the table is for, valid values are ["continuous" | "pulsed" | "both"].

   **<frequency>**
      A frequency value.

   **<db-ration>**
      The signal-to-noise ratio required for detection at the indicated frequency.

   When defining a signal-type- and frequency-dependent table, the following rule(s) must be noted:

   * Any 'frequency' entry that occurs before the first 'signal_type' entry is assumed to apply to the "both" (i.e.,
     continuous and pulsed) signal-types. If a signal_type is then entered the corresponding data entered before for that
     signal-type will be cleared and the new data entered.

   The process for determining threshold uses the following algorithm:

   * If a signal-type-dependent table is being used, the signal-type of the received signal is used to locate the
     appropriate signal-type-specific set of frequency entries.
   * Frequencies greater than or equal *frequency-value-m* and less than *frequency-value-m+1* will use *db-ratio-m*
   * Frequencies less than *frequency-value-1* will use *db-ratio-1*.
   * Frequencies greater than or equal to *frequency-value-n* will use *db-ratio-n*.

   .. note::

      Entries will be sorted into increasing order of frequency.

   .. note::

      If detection_threshold_ and/or continuous_detection_threshold_ and/or
      pulsed_detection_threshold_ and/or detection_thresholds_ and/or sensitivity_threshold and/or
      continuous_sensitivity_threshold and/or pulsed_sensitivity_threshold and/or
      detection_sensitivities_ are specified, the last one is used.

   .. note::

      If neither detection_threshold_ and/or continuous_detection_threshold_ and/or
      pulsed_detection_threshold_ and/or detection_thresholds_ and/or sensitivity_threshold and/or
      continuous_sensitivity_threshold and/or pulsed_sensitivity_threshold and/or
      detection_sensitivities_ are specified, the detection_threshold will assumed to be 3.0 dB for pulsed and
      continuous signal-types

.. block:: WSF_PASSIVE_SENSOR

.. command:: detection_probability

   Defines a function of probability of detection (Pd) versus received signal strength (expressed as a ratio of the
   received power to the detection sensitivity). The table is defined as follows::

      detection_probability
         signal <db-ratio-1> pd <pd-value-1>
         signal <db-ratio-2> pd <pd-value-2>
         ...
         signal <db-ratio-n> pd <pd-value-n>
      end_detection_probability

   **<db-ratio-n>**
      The ratio of the received signal power to the detection sensitivity.

   **<pd-value-n>**
      The probability of detection associated with the ratio.

   Signals that exceed the limits of the table will be clamped to the appropriate endpoint. Intermediate values will be
   determined using linear interpolation.

   If this function is not defined then a binary detector is used. The Pd will be 1.0 if the signal level is equal to or
   exceeds the detection sensitivity.

   Default: Function is not defined - the binary detector is used.

   .. note::

      If detection_threshold_ or detection_thresholds_ is used, the detection sensitivity will
      be computed as the detection threshold times the noise power.

.. command:: scan_on_scan_model <boolean-value>

   Specifies if the Probabilistic Scan-On-Scan (PSOS) model should be employed. This model attempts to probabilistically
   capture the temporal effects in which the passive sensor is scanning in frequency and the emitter may be scanning in angle.

   If the model is **off**, detection attempts will assume the target emitter is pointed (as closely as possible) directly
   at the passive sensor and that the passive sensor is currently attempting to detect the frequency at which the target emitter
   is emitting. This often results in an overly optimistic detection results.

   If the model is **on**, the detection attempts will probabilistically consider the fact that the target emitter may be
   rotating and that the passive sensor may be scanning in frequency. The probabilistic frequency effects will be employed
   only if dwell_time_ and revisit_time_ are specified for every frequency_band_.

   Default: off

.. command:: azimuth_error_sigma_table

.. command:: elevation_error_sigma_table

.. command:: range_error_sigma_table

   These commands provide the ability to define error sigmas that are a function of the frequency of the received signal
   instead of the fixed sigmas that are provided by the single-valued :command:`sensor_mode.azimuth_error_sigma`,
   :command:`sensor_mode.elevation_error_sigma` and :command:`sensor_mode.range_error_sigma` commands. The points define a curve on a plot
   whose x-axis is the log_10 of the frequency and the y-axis is the error sigma. Linear interpolation is used to derive
   the values for intermediate frequencies. Signals whose frequencies are outside the range of the table use the value
   from the appropriate endpoint (i.e., extrapolation is not performed).

   The format of the command follows

   ::

      type_error_sigma_table
         frequency <frequency-1> <error-sigma-1>
         frequency <frequency-2> <error-sigma-2>
         ...
         frequency <frequency-n> <error-sigma-n>
      end_type_error_sigma_table

   *type* is **azimuth**, **elevation** or **range** and *<error-sigma>* is a sigma using the same format as the values in
   :command:`sensor_mode.azimuth_error_sigma`, :command:`sensor_mode.elevation_error_sigma` and
   :command:`sensor_mode.range_error_sigma` commands. Independent tables may be provided for each *type*.

   .. note::

         The entries must in order of monotonically increasing frequency.

   .. note::

         Providing a table will override any specification of its single-valued counterpart.

.. command:: ranging_time <time-value>

   Adds range information to any track generated by this sensor after the specified time has elapsed.  This basically
   simulates that the system could triangulate and get the range after a sufficient period of time.

.. command:: ranging_time_track_quality <quality-value>

   If the ranging time is used to generate a track with range information, this parameter controls the track quality once
   range is valid.  The quality-value must be non-negative.
