Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_AD_HOC` is a generic router protocol, providing user-defined
script methods to define the behavior of the routing protocol. This protocol allows
users to define the behaviors reflected in the network knowledge maintained in the router when
changes are made to network state. Although intended to enable ad-hoc capabilities, it can also
be used in any circumstance in which users want to define their own routing call implementation
via a scripted interface.

This protocol is limited, for practical and performance reasons, to only consider changes in
network state to the network membership of the comm interfaces assigned to the router. Changes
external to these networks are not considered by this protocol.

Changes that do occur during runtime to one of the networks of interest to this protocol
will call the corresponding script method to allow user-defined logic to execute, along with
a corresponding return value to indicate the action to be taken regarding that event.

Time delays are also provided for most of the events this protocol monitors, to allow either constant
or distribution-based delays in state updates. This is provided to emulate potential delays in
acquiring notification of these events at the router due to typical network latency effects,
delays in how a particular protocol being modeled distributes this data, etc.

.. note:: This protocol can be performance intensive if the network(s) this protocol monitors for
   state changes contains many members, or if many routers with this protocol exist in the simulation
   simultaneously.

Commands
========

.. command:: comm_added_delay_time <random-time-reference>

   Defines the delay to be taken between when a network being monitored adds a comm interface and when
   this protocol will execute the :command:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_AD_HOC.OnCommAdded` script method, potentially adding an interface
   to the network state graph.

   **Default**: No delay (constant 0 s)

.. command:: comm_removed_delay_time <random-time-reference>

   Defines the delay to be taken between when a network being monitored removes a comm interface and when
   this protocol will execute the :command:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_AD_HOC.OnCommRemoved` script method, potentially removing an interface
   on the network state graph.

   Note that this method only handles the removal of the node itself, and not the connections that relied
   on that node's existence.

   **Default**: No delay (constant 0 s)

.. command:: connection_added_delay_time <random-time-reference>

   Defines the delay to be taken between when a network being monitored adds a link or connection and when
   this protocol will execute the :command:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_AD_HOC.OnConnectionAdded` script method, potentially adding a
   connection to the network state graph.

   **Default**: No delay (constant 0 s)

.. command:: connection_removed_delay_time <random-time-reference>

   Defines the delay to be taken between when a network being monitored removes a link or connection and when
   this protocol will execute the :command:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_AD_HOC.OnConnectionRemoved` script method, potentially removing a
   connection from the network state graph.

   **Default**: No delay (constant 0 s)

.. command:: OnCommAdded (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script bool OnCommAdded(:class:`WsfAddress` aAddedComm, :class:`WsfCommGraph` aNetworkState, :class:`WsfCommRouter` aRouter)
      ...
      end_script

   Defines an optional script that is invoked (after delays) when a comm interface is added. This is only invoked when
   the interface being added shares a network with one of the interfaces on the router this protocol belongs to, or pertains
   directly to one of the router interfaces.

   A boolean value **MUST** be returned from this script indicating whether the protocol should add this interface to
   its network state graph (true) or should not take any action (false).

.. command:: OnCommRemoved (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script bool OnCommRemoved(:class:`WsfAddress` aAddedComm, :class:`WsfCommGraph` aNetworkState, :class:`WsfCommRouter` aRouter)
      ...
      end_script

   Defines an optional script that is invoked (after delays) when a comm interface is removed. This is only invoked when
   the interface being removed shares a network with one of the interfaces on the router this protocol belongs to, or pertains
   directly to one of the router interfaces.

   A boolean value **MUST** be returned from this script indicating whether the protocol should remove this interface from
   its network state graph (true) or should not take any action (false).

.. command:: OnConnectionAdded (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script bool OnConnectionAdded(:class:`WsfAddress` aSourceComm, :class:`WsfAddress` aDestinationComm, :class:`WsfCommGraph` aNetworkState, :class:`WsfCommRouter` aRouter)
      ...
      end_script

   Defines an optional script that is invoked (after delays) when a connection is added. This is only invoked when **one** of the
   involved interfaces (either the source or destination) shares a network with one of the interfaces on the router this
   protocol belongs to.

   A boolean value **MUST** be returned from this script indicating whether the protocol should add this connection to
   its network state graph (true) or should not take any action (false).

.. command:: OnConnectionRemoved (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script bool OnConnectionRemoved(:class:`WsfAddress` aSourceComm, :class:`WsfAddress` aDestinationComm, :class:`WsfCommGraph` aNetworkState, :class:`WsfCommRouter` aRouter)
      ...
      end_script

   Defines an optional script that is invoked (after delays) when a connection is removed. This is only invoked when **one** of the
   involved interfaces (either the source or destination) shares a network with one of the interfaces on the router this
   protocol belongs to.

   A boolean value **MUST** be returned from this script indicating whether the protocol should remove this connection from its network state graph (true) or should not take any action (false).

.. command:: OnMessageRouting (script)

   .. parsed-literal::

      script :class:`WsfAddress` OnMessageRouting(:class:`WsfCommMessage` aMessage, :class:`WsfAddress` aInterface, :class:`WsfCommGraph` aNetworkState, :class:`WsfCommRouter` aRouter)
      ...
      end_script

   Defines an optional script that is invoked immediately when a message requires routing on an interface belonging to this
   protocol's router.

   A :class:`WsfAddress` **MUST** be returned from this script indicating the next hop address to forward this message.
   If a null address is provided (by not setting the address for the returned object) then this indicates that this protocol
   should drop the message and not attempt forwarding the message. Any other address will be used as the indicated forwarding
   address, and MUST be directly connected to the interface receiving the message (provided via the **aInterface** parameter).

   Note that many of the details are provided to make most routing determinations, including the information provided directly
   from the message itself (traceroute, destination address, etc.) the current graph state (pathing), and the router itself.
