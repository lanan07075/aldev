Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_MEDIUM_GUIDED` is a generic guided medium type.

A guided medium is also sometimes referred as a bounded or wired medium. This medium provides basic
medium capabilities typically associated with guided communication framework objects in previous
versions of AFSIM.

This medium type is valid for the following communication object models in the AFSIM core.

* :model:`WSF_COMM_RCVR <WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER>`
* :model:`WSF_COMM_XMTR <WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER>`
* :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER`
* :model:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER`

Commands
========

.. command:: propagation_speed <random-speed-reference>

   Sets the speed of message propagation.
   
   This command, when defined outside of a :command:`medium.mode` block, specifies the propagation speed
   for the "default" mode associated with the medium.

   **Default** c (speed of light constant)

.. command:: transfer_rate <random-data-rate-reference>

   Sets the amount of data that can be transmitted by this medium over a set period of time.
   
   This command, when defined outside of a :command:`medium.mode` block, specifies the transfer rate
   for the "default" mode associated with this medium.

   **Default** -1 (instantaneous transfer)
   
.. command:: packet_loss_time <random-time-reference>

   Sets a time that adds to the delay in every transmission over this medium. Although indicated as a delay due
   to packet loss, this value can be used to introduce a delay to the normal transmission time over the medium
   for any reason, or as an aggregate delay due to modeling multiple sources of transmission delay.
   
   This command, when defined outside of a :command:`medium.mode` block, specifies the packet loss time
   for the "default" mode associated with this medium.

   **Default** 0 (no delay)
