Overview
========

A zone_set is a zone which is composed of discrete zone components known as zone set elements.
A zone set element may be either an inclusion zone or an exclusion zone.
Further, a zone set element may be either an embedded zone or a use_zone.
Embedded zones are defined directly within the definition of the containing zone set.
Use zones are copies of externally defined zones which are added to the zone set. 

A point is considered to be contained in the zone set if it is contained within at least one inclusion
zone and *not* contained in any exclusion zones.
To be functional, a zone_set must contain at least one inclusion zone.

A zone_set is a :doc:`zone`. Therefore, a zone set is defined by zone properties, including:

* Set-wise :ref:`docs/zone:Context`
* Element-wise :ref:`docs/zone:Geometry`
* Element-wise :ref:`docs/zone:Bounds`
* Element-wise :ref:`docs/zone:Reference Frame and Pose`

Commands
========

.. command:: zone ... end_zone

   Create an embedded :command:`zone` that will act as an *inclusion* zone for this :command:`zone_set`.

   .. note::
      This command may occur 0 or more times.


.. command:: exclude_zone ... end_exclude_zone

   Create an embedded :command:`zone` that will act as an *exclusion* zone for this :command:`zone_set`.

   .. note::
      This command may occur 0 or more times.

.. command:: use_zone <shared_zone_name>

   Declare that the specified shared zone is to be an *inclusion* zone for this zone set.

   .. note::
      This command may occur 0 or more times.


.. command:: use_exclude_zone <shared_zone_name>

   Declare that the specified shared zone is to be an *exclusion* zone for this zone set.

   .. note::
      This command may occur 0 or more times.
