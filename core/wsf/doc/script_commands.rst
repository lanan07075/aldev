Script Commands
---------------

.. block:: _.script_commands

.. command:: script_call_trace [ off | on ]

   Controls whether a trace of script method calls will be written to standard output. This can be very useful for
   debugging complex scripts. If enabled, a line indicating the time, platform, platform part name and script name is
   written prior to calling the method. Upon return from the method another line is written which contains the function
   return value.

   This command can appear at the global level, inside a platform or inside a platform component. The default global value
   is false. If this command is specified at the global level then it will apply to all platforms and their components for
   which a value has not been explicitly defined. If this occurs at the platform level then it applies to the platform and
   any component on the platform for which a value has not been explicitly defined.

   .. note::
      The resulting trace only includes scripts that are **directly** invoked from WSF. It does not
      include scripts that are invoked by the scripts. This will probably be implemented in a future release.

   .. note::
      This can produce **a lot** of output (especially when used at the global level).

.. command:: script_debug_writes [ off | on ]

   Controls whether the script debug write statements write_d and writeln_d are executed. If enabled, write_d and
   writeln_d statements are executed.

   This command can appear at the global level, inside a platform or inside a platform component. The default global value
   is false. If this command is specified at the global level then it will apply to all platforms and their components for
   which a value has not been explicitly defined. If this occurs at the platform level then it applies to the platform and
   any component on the platform for which a value has not been explicitly defined.

   The "write_d" writes a line without a carriage return.
   The "writeln_d" writes a line with a carriage return.

   .. note::
      The use of "write" and "writeln" are not affected by this command.

.. command:: script_abort_on_null_references [ off | on ]

   When a script method is called with an invalid object or argument, an error is printed to the screen.  When this option
   is enabled, the application will also terminate immediately.  This command is only available in a global context.

   **Default:** off

.. command:: script_abort_on_assert [ off | on]

   When a call to :method:`assert() <__BUILTIN__.assert>` in script fails, the application will usually abort.  Setting this option to
   'off' will still print an error but will not abort the application.

   **Default:** on

.. command:: script ... end_script

   Defines a script.

.. command:: script_variables ... end_script_variables

   Allows users to declare a set of variables that are accessible to scripts within a given context. For example, if the
   script_variables_ command is used inside the platform command, then all scripts defined within that platform have
   access to the variables that are defined. In addition, any scriptable platform parts can access their parents variables
   by using the **extern** keyword.

   The script_variables_ block accepts standard :command:`_.script_commands.script` variable declaration, definition and assignment commands
   with the exception that definition and assignment cannot invoke functions or other scripts.

.. command:: script_interface ... end_script_interface

   Configures the scripting system.
   Multiple script_interface_ blocks may be provided. If the same subcommand is specified in multiple blocks then
   the last value given will be used

SUBCOMMANDS
===========

.. command:: debug

   Tells the compiler to produce a source listing and any errors that may occur during compilation (by default debug
   output is turned off).

.. command:: no_debug

   Tells the compiler not to produce the source and detailed error listing. The compiler will still display a simple
   message if an error occurs during compilation.

.. command:: script ... end_script

   Defines a script that is callable by all platforms in the simulation.
