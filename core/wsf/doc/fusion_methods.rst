   Specifies the fusion algorithms used by the track manager.

   A fusion algorithm combines information about a single entity from two or more sources into a coherent information set, or :command:`track`.

**<fusion-method>** can be:

Each type has its own unique input keywords.

Correlated measurements and tracks are fused according to a standard set of algorithms.  Local track positions are replaced by nonlocal track positions.

   end_fusion_method

.. block:: fusion_method.replacement

Correlated measurements and tracks are fused according to a standard set of algorithms.  Local track positions are combined with nonlocal track positions using the covariance matrices of the local and nonlocal tracks.

.. note::
   If there is no covariance matrix associated with a nonlocal track, the track manager will attempt to use a measurement covariance matrix, generated from the track's measurement errors in range, elevation, and bearing.
