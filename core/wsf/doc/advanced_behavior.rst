advanced_behavior
-----------------

advanced_behaviors are similar to normal :command:`behaviors<behavior>`, with the addition of 3-state and blackboard functionality, as well as additional visualization features.

3-State
=======

Advanced behaviors allow the scripter to return based around 3 states rather than 2.

Inside of precondition and execute blocks, return statements should return either a double/float for weighted_random and priority_selector, or one of the 3 states below.
These return statements will inform the behavior tree of what state to set for the node that tick.  An optional string may be given that will set the tooltip text for
the node in the Behavior Tree Tool in Mystic.  This can be useful for seeing what the node is currently doing.

.. command:: return [Running(<string>) | Success(<string>) | Failure(<string>)];

Commands
========

.. command:: name <string>

   Name the node.  The new name will be displayed on the node in the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>` in Mystic.

.. command:: desc <string>

   Define a description for the node.  This will show when the node is hovered over in the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>` in Mystic.

.. command:: color <color-value>
   
   Set the color to display as a platform trace line in Mystic to indicate when the behavior is running.
