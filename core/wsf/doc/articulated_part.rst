Articulated Part Commands
-------------------------

Overview
========


.. note::
   This section is just a reference for the various commands.

These commands specify the location and orientation of :command:`communications <comm>` and :command:`sensor`
:ref:`subsystems <Platform_Subsystem>` with respect to the platform on which they are contained. They also specify the
degrees of freedom and limits through which the part can rotate in response to a pointing request (cue).

If a request is made to cue the device outside the slew limits, the resulting cue will be as close as possible without
exceeding the limits.

.. block:: _.articulated_part

Commands
========

.. command:: location <x length-value> <y length-value> <z length-value> <length-unit>
   
   Specify the location of the origin of the articulated part with respect to the origin of the entity coordinate system.
   
   **Default:** 0 0 0 meters

.. command:: yaw <angle-value>
   
   Specifies the yaw angle of the articulated part with respect to the entity to which it is attached.
   
   **Default:** 0.0 degrees

.. command:: pitch <angle-value>
   
   Specifies the pitch of the articulated part with respect to the entity to which it is attached.
   
   **Default:** 0.0 degrees

   .. note::
      This command **must not** be used to specify the tilt angle for a system that rotates about its
      vertical axis (such as an early warning radar or a fixed elevation turret-mounted launcher). Use the
      :command:`_.antenna_commands.antenna_tilt` command or the **beam_tilt** commands in the
      :command:`_.receiver.beam_tilt` and :command:`_.transmitter.beam_tilt` blocks for sensors and the **tilt**
      command below for launcher.

.. command:: roll <angle-value>
   
   Specifies the roll of the articulated part with respect to the entity to which it is attached.
   
   **Default:** 0.0 degrees

.. command:: tilt <angle-value>
   
   Used to specify the fixed elevation angle of a launcher that can be cued in azimuth. See the note in the pitch_
   command for the explanation.

.. command:: slew_mode [ fixed | azimuth | elevation | both | azimuth_and_elevation]
   
   The slewing mode (and the corresponding limits) defines the ability of a subsystem to respond to cue.  If a system is
   not cued then it is oriented in the direction specified by yaw_, pitch_, and roll_.
   
   * **fixed** - The system cannot be cued.
   * **azimuth** - The system can be cued only in azimuth. The angular limits are defined by azimuth_slew_limits_.
   * **elevation** - The system can be cued only in elevation. The angular limits are defined by
     elevation_slew_limits_.
   * **both** or **azimuth_and_elevation** - The system can be cued in both azimuth and elevation. The angular limits are
     defined by azimuth_slew_limits_ and elevation_slew_limits_.
   
   **Default:** **fixed**

.. command:: azimuth_slew_limits <min-angle-value angle-value> <max-angle-value angle-value> 
   
   Specify the absolute minimum and maximum angle about which the subsystem can be slewed in azimuth for both cueing and
   scanning. The limits are specified in the part coordinate system (PCS).
   
   If **slew_mode** is **azimuth** or **both** then these represent the azimuth limits for an explicit cue request (See
   Cueing above).
   
   **Default:** -180 degrees to 180 degrees

.. command:: elevation_slew_limits < min-angle-value angle-value> <max-angle-value angle-value>
   
   Specify the minimum and maximum angle about which the subsystem can be slewed in elevation for both cueing and
   scanning. The limits are specified in the part coordinate system (PCS).
   
   If **slew_mode** is **elevation** or **both** then these represent the elevation limits for an explicit cue (See
   Cueing above).
   
   **Default:** -90 degrees to 90 degrees

.. command:: azimuth_slew_rate <angle-rate-value>
.. command:: elevation_slew_rate <angle-rate-value>
   
   Specify the angular velocities to be employed when slewing the part to satisfy a cueing request. This is primarily used
   for modeling systems that track or point at a single target such as a mechanical tracker or a gun system. It is not
   used for scanning systems, and should not be used for multiple-target tracking systems.
   
   The value must be greater than zero, and values greater than or equal to 1.0E+12 deg/sec will be treated as 'infinite'.
   
   **Default:** Infinite (instantaneous slewing)

.. command:: slew_method [ independent | coordinated ]
   
   If non-infinite slew rates ares employed, this command specifies how the intermediate steps of a slewing operation will
   occur. If *independent* is specified, the amount of movement in each direction within a time interval will be
   determined independently, meaning that one direction may hit its desired value before the other direction. If
   *coordinated* is specified then the rates will be adjusted so azimuth and elevation values will both reach the
   desired value at the same time.
   
   **Default:** **independent**

.. command:: masking_pattern <masking-pattern-name>
   
   Specify the name of a masking pattern defined with the global :command:`masking_pattern` command. Masking patterns are a
   mechanism for modeling obscuration by structural elements on the platform.
   
   See the global :command:`masking_pattern` command for more information.
   
   **Default:** No masking pattern
