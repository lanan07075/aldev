.. _dis_interface.Overview:

Overview
========

The dis_interface block is used to specify the attributes of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) interface.  The DIS interface provides the ability to participate in a DIS exercise or to create a replay file that can be displayed by visualization tools. Use the broadcast_ or multicast_ command to participate in a DIS exercise. Use the record_ command to generate a replay file.

Multiple :command:`dis_interface` blocks may be provided. If the same subcommand is specified in multiple blocks then the last value given will be used.

.. warning::
   The commands mover_update_timer_ and heartbeat_timer_ may force :command:`platform.mover` updates within a simulation. Setting the `mover_update_timer`_ to 0.0 secs and the heartbeat timer to a very large value (i.e. greater than the simulation :command:`end_time`) will prevent this at the cost of not moving platforms in the simulation until events require them.

.. _dis_interface.Connection_Commands:

Connection Commands
===================

These commands define how the simulation will connect to other simulation participants.

.. command:: connections ... end_connections
             edit_connections ... end_edit_connections

   By default, the :command:`dis_interface` supports a single input/output (replay file, playback file, or network address). Connection information in this connections block allows for multiple output types.  Subcommands available include record_, playback_, broadcast_, multicast_, unicast_, port_, send_port_, and receive_port_.

   When using connections ... end_connections, all previous DIS output commands are replaced by the new user input.  When using edit_connections ... end_edit_connections, existing DIS output commands are retained.

   .. note::
      Port commands should immediately follow broadcast, multicast or unicast commands inside the connections block.

   Example::

    #  Set up multiple network connections
    #  All previous connection commands are discarded!
    connections
       unicast_ 192.168.1.1
       port_ 9392
       unicast_ 192.168.1.2
       port_ 9393
       broadcast_ 192.168.255.255
       port_ 5828
    end_connections
    ...
    #  Add a new replay file output, leaving existing outputs intact.
    edit_connections
       record_ my_replay.rep
    end_edit_connections

.. command:: record <filename>

   Record the simulation to the specified file.

   .. note::
      When used outside the connections_ block, the record_, playback_, broadcast_, multicast_, and unicast_ commands are mutually exclusive. Only the last occurrence will be used.

   .. note::
      To insert the run number in the file name use "*%d*".

      For example::

         file replay_%d.rep

.. command:: playback <filename>

   Causes entity state data contained within the specified file to be read and injected into simulation. **ONLY** entity state data is used - all other PDUs are ignored. The entity_type_ command is used to define the mapping of DIS entity types to WSF platforms, just as in a standard DIS simulation. Entity state PDUs are also written to the record_ file if defined.

   All subsystems within the platform are removed prior to being added to the simulation, and the mover is replaced with a special one that uses the entity state. The signature data will be retrieved from the platform type, defined by the entity_type_ mapping.

   One advantage of this feature is that it can be used in constructive (e.g., non-real-time simulations).

   .. note::
      The DIS 'site' of the entities will be changed to eliminate possible conflicts with the any other input stream.

   .. note::
      When used outside the connections_ block, the record_, playback_, broadcast_, multicast_, and unicast_ commands are mutually exclusive. Only the last occurrence will be used.

.. command:: broadcast  <broadcast-IP-address>

   Participate in a DIS exercise on the indicated broadcast network. For example, if your ethernet port address is 192.168.1.14 and the netmask is set to 255.255.0.0, the command would be "broadcast 192.168.255.255".

   .. note::
      The port_ command must also be specified.

   .. note::
      When used outside the connections_ block, the record_, playback_, broadcast_, multicast_, and unicast_ commands are mutually exclusive. Only the last occurrence will be used.

.. command:: multicast <multicast-IP-address> <interface-address>

   Participate in the DIS exercise on the specified multicast network. The port_ command must also be specified.

   <multicast-IP-address>
      An address in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

   <interface-address>
      The machine's IP address on the desired interface.  The IP may be abbreviated. Ex: **<tt> multicast 225.1.2.3  192.168 </tt>**.

   .. note::
      When used outside the connections_ block, the record_, playback_, broadcast_,  multicast_, and unicast_ commands are mutually exclusive. Only the last occurrence will be used.


.. command:: unicast <unicast-address>

   Communicate DIS traffic with a single endpoint.  *unicast-address* can be an IP address or a host-name.  The
   port_ command must also be specified.

   .. note::
      When used outside the connections_ block, the record_, playback_, broadcast_, multicast_, and unicast_ commands are mutually exclusive. Only the last occurrence will be used.

.. command:: port <IP-port-number>

   Specify the port number for broadcast_, multicast_, and unicast_ modes.

.. command:: send_port <IP-port-number>
             receive_port <IP-port-number>

   Specify the send and receive port numbers for broadcast_, multicast_, and unicast_ modes.  Both send_port and receive_port must be specified together, and act as a replacement for the port command.  This command is primarily used with unicast_ mode.

.. command:: time_to_live <ttl-value>

   Specify the 'time-to-live' value for multicast_ communications in the range [0, 255].

   ::

      As the values of the TTL field increase, routers will expand the number of hops they will forward for a multicast packet. To provide meaningful scope control, multicast routers enforce the following "thresholds" on forwarding based on the TTL field:

       * "0"   Restricts the outgoing packets to the same host
       * "1"   Restricts the outgoing packets to the same subnet
       * "32"  Restricts the outgoing packets to the same site
       * "64"  Restricts the outgoing packets to the same region
       * "128" Restricts the outgoing packets to the same continent
       * "255" No restriction
       * The default is set by the operating system, which is typically set to a low value.

.. _dis_interface.Filtered_Output_Connection_Commands:

Filtered Output Connection Commands
===================================

These input blocks allow for output-filtered connections to other simulation participants.

.. command:: filtered_connection ... end_filtered_connection
   :block:

   Connection information in each filtered_connection block allows for a subset of the DIS PDUs to be output to the  specified device.  If no device (output type, address, port) exists yet, one is appended to the connections list (as in edit_connections).  Subcommands available include record_, broadcast_, multicast_, unicast_, port_, and allow_.  The unique subcommand allow_ provides a way to specify what type of DIS PDUs will be allowed out of this connection to the given device.

   When using filtered_connection ... end_filtered_connection, existing DIS output connections are retained.  If the same connection was previously defined, it is overwritten as a filtered connection and the filters will apply.  If no such connection was previously defined, then the connection is created and added, filters apply.

   .. note::
      Port commands should immediately follow broadcast, multicast or unicast commands inside the connections block.

   Example::

      # Set up multiple output filtered network connections

      # send to 192.168.10.46 : 3225, only entity state PDUs with
      # blue force entities, and red force entities that are tracked by blue

      filtered_connection
         unicast     192.168.10.46
         port        3225
         allow       force    blue     all
         allow       force    red      tracked  blue
      end_filtered_connection

      # broadcast to 130.38.255.255 : 3227, only entity state PDUs with
      # all entities of type BLUE_AIRLINER.  Also send entity
      # state PDUs with entities of type DRONE that are
      # tracked by blue

      filtered_connection
         broadcast   130.38.255.255
         port        3227
         allow       entity_type    BLUE_AIRLINER   all
         allow       entity_type    DRONE           tracked  blue
      end_filtered_connection


   .. command:: allow entity_type <type> [all / tracked <by force>]

      Specify a WSF entity type that is allowed to be output from the filtered connection.

   .. command:: allow force <force> [all / tracked <by force>]

      Specify a WSF entity force that is allowed to be output from the filtered connection.

      .. note::
         When used outside, only the last occurrence will be used.

   .. block:: dis_interface

.. _dis_interface.Simulation_Control_Commands:

Simulation Control Commands
===========================

These commands are used to specify general parameters for the simulation.

.. command:: protocol_version <protocol-version-id>

   Specify the DIS protocol version in the range [0, 6].

   **Default:** 5

.. command:: exercise <dis-exercise-id>

   Specify the DIS exercise ID in the range [1, 255].

   **Default:** 1

.. command:: site <dis-site-id>

   Specify the DIS site ID in the range [1, 65534].

   **Default:** 1

.. command:: application <dis-application-id>

   Specify the DIS application ID in the range [1, 65534].

   **Default:** 1

.. command:: join_exercise
             no_join_exercise

   Specify if the application should join the exercise (specified by the exercise_ command) as a participant in a DIS non-real-time scaled-and-stepped simulation.

   **Default:** no_join_exercise

.. command:: autostart

   Do not wait for a Start/Resume PDU to start the simulation.

   **Default:** no_autostart

.. command:: no_autostart

   Wait for a Start/Resume PDU to start the simulation. This is the default.

.. command:: deferred_connection_time <time-value>

   The application will defer joining the exercise until the specified simulation time is reached. Prior to that time it will run as fast as possible and not send data to or receive data from the DIS exercise. When the desired time is reached, the application will connect to the network or begin writing the replay file. The simulation clock will behave as defined by the autostart_ or no_autostart_ command. The minimum valid time-value for this command is one second.

.. command:: absolute_timestamp

   Specify that absolute timestamps are to be used the PDUs produced by this application.

   **Default:** Relative timestamps are used.

.. command:: ignore_pdu_time

   Ignore the time from the PDU and use the current perception of simulation time.

.. command:: use_pdu_time

   Use the time from the PDU as the effective event time. It is recommended not to use this command for large simulations.

   **Default:** ignore_pdu_time

.. command:: mover_update_timer <time-value>

   If greater than 0, the interface will generate events to force platforms to update their position at the specified interval. This is useful for event-driven simulations where position updates may occur infrequently due to the lack of interaction between objects.

   .. note::
      Time-stepped simulations (e.g., a simulation that uses the WsfFrameStepSimulation with the "-rt' flag) should set this value to 0 to prevent the extra updates as such simulations already cause mover updates at a high rate.

   **Default:** 1.0 seconds

.. command:: heartbeat_timer <time-value>

   Specify the DIS heartbeat timer. For internally controlled entities, this defines the maximum amount of time that can elapse between transmission of Entity State PDUs. The simulation will force an Entity State PDU to be sent if required. To drastically reduce replay file sizes for large simulations, set the heartbeat_timer to a value of 20 or greater.

   **Default:** 5.0 seconds

.. command:: heartbeat_multiplier <real-value>

   Specify the DIS heartbeat multiplier. For externally controlled entities, heartbeat_timer_ values; heartbeat_multiplier_ defines the maximum amount time that can elapse without receiving an Entity State PDU before an entity is declared 'inactive' and removed from the simulation.

   **Default:** 2.4

.. command:: initial_distribution_interval <time-value>

   When participating in a distributed exercise (using broadcast_ or multicast_), the interface will spread out transmission of initial state data to avoid overloading the network. This command provides a mechanism to explicitly specify the initial distribution interval.

   **Default:** The value of the heartbeat_timer_

.. command:: entity_position_threshold <length-value>

   Specify the DIS entity position threshold.

   **Default:** 1.0 meters

.. command:: entity_orientation_threshold <angle-value>

   Specify the DIS entity orientation threshold.

   **Default:** 3.0 degrees

.. command:: maximum_beam_entries <positive-integer>

   Specify the maximum number of beam entries that will be transmitted in the 'system' portion of an Electromagnetic Emission PDU.

   **Default:** No limit (up to the maximum number that can be stored without exceeding the size limit of the containing DIS 'system').

.. command:: maximum_track_jam_entries <positive-integer>

   Specify the maximum number of track-jam entries that will be transmitted in the 'beam' portion of an Electromagnetic Emission PDU before the high-density track-jam mode will be selected.

   **Default:** No limit (up to the maximum number that can be stored without exceeding the size limit of the containing DIS 'system').

   .. note::
      The IEEE DIS standard specifies a limit of 10. If conformance to the standard is desired then command must be specified with a value of 10.

.. command:: sensor_update_interval <time-value>

   This is used to force Electromagnetic Emissions PDUs to be sent out at approximately the specified update interval in addition to the standard rules. This is primarily used to force PDUs to be sent more frequently with an updated 'Beam Sweep Sync' in the DIS Beam record. This allows the receiver to have more accurate knowledge of where a scanning sensor is within its scan pattern.

   If a value of 0 seconds is specified then no extra updates will be sent.

   **Default:** 0 seconds (No extra periodic updates are sent)

.. _dis_interface.Mapping_Commands:

Mapping Commands
================

These commands define the mappings between DIS and WSF objects.

.. command:: force <side> <dis-force-id>

   Specify the DIS force identifier that corresponds to a WSF platform side.  This command should be specified for each side that is present in the scenario. If no **force** commands are provided then the following defaults will be defined:

   .. parsed-literal::

    force_ blue  1
    force_ red   2
    force_ green 3

   .. note::
      If any **force** commands are present then the above defaults will not be used.

.. command:: entity_type <platform_type> <dis-entity-type>

   Specify the DIS entity type to be used when sending PDUs for platforms or munitions with the indicated WSF platform type. This command should be specified for each WSF platform type that is present in the scenario. If the type of a platform does not have a corresponding DIS entity type then 0:0:0:0:0:0:0 will be used. For proper WSF interaction of received DIS entities from other networked simulations, a corresponding simple platform_type must be created with defined signatures.

   Example

   .. parsed-literal::

     entity_type_ JUMBO_JET    1:2:225:1:5:5:0
     entity_type_ REGIONAL_JET 1:2:225:1:9:10:0


.. command:: unknown_platform_type <platform-type>

   Specify the type of the WSF platform to be created for an external entity if an applicable entity_type_ entry does not exist.

.. command:: entity_appearance  ... end_entity_appearance

   Specify the DIS Entity Appearance type and state or ID associated with a specified signature state. To identify the appearance mapping:

   .. parsed-literal::

   *<script-name>*
      The name of a script on the platform.

   .. note::
      See :ref:`DIS_Articulation` for an example on how to use the 'articulation' capability.

   .. warning::
      Afterburner is only valid for air platform types per DIS standards (IEEE Std 1278.1-1995 supplement SISO-REF-010-2006). Configuration is currently implemented only for air platform types.}}

.. command:: articulated_part <platform-type> <part-name> <part-id> ... end_articulated_part

   The articulated part block indicates that a platform type should publish an articulated part to DIS.  The part may be a :command:`comm`, :command:`sensor`, or :command:`visual_part`. The block may contain the following commands:

   * parent *<parent-id>* If present, this indicates that the part should be parented to another articulated part.  A part will inherit the motion of its parent.
   * publish *<degree-of-freedom>* The publish command indicates which degrees-of-freedom are to be published in the DIS entity state PDUs.  The possible degrees-of-freedom are:

     * x - The x component of the part's position.
     * y - The y component of the part's position.
     * z - The z component of the part's position.
     * x_rate - The rate of change in the x component of the part's position.
     * y_rate - The rate of change in the y component of the part's position.
     * z_rate - The rate of change in the z component of the part's position.

     * rotation_rate - The rate of motion about the part's x-axis.

   * *<platform-type>* : The type name of the platform that will include articulations in its DIS PDUs.
   * *<part-name>* : The name of the articulated part that will be included in the entity-state PDUs.
   * *<part-id>* : The ID that will be sent over DIS to represent the part in the entity-state PDUs.

.. command:: emitter_type <sensor-type> <dis-emitter-name-enum>

   Specify the DIS 'emitter name' enumeration associated with specified WSF systems that emit electromagnetic energy (e.g., sensors). For outbound electromagnetic emission PDUs this defines the value for the 'emitter name' field in the PDU for a given WSF emitter. For inbound PDUs, a reverse lookup is performed to determine the WSF sensor type needed to provide the additional characteristics to properly model interactions with the externally modeled emitter.

.. command:: emitter_function <sensor-type> <dis-emitter-function-enum>

   Specify the DIS 'emitter function' enumeration with specified WSF systems that emit electromagnetic energy (e.g., sensors). This is only applicable for outbound electromagnetic emission PDUs.

.. command:: beam_type <sensor-type> <sensor-mode-name> <sensor-beam-number> <dis-beam-parameter-index-value>

   Specify the DIS Emissions PDU 'beam parameter index' value associated with specified WSF systems that emit electromagnetic energy (e.g., sensors). For outbound electromagnetic emission PDUs this defines the value for the 'beam parameter index' field in the PDU for a given WSF emitter beam. For inbound PDUs, this field is **NOT** currently used within WSF.

   *<sensor-type>*
     The type name of the sensor.

   *<sensor-mode-name>*
     The mode name of interest for the given sensor type. Use '*' to represent any mode.

   *<sensor-beam-number>*
     The beam number in the range of [1, 255] of interest for the given mode on the sensor type. Use '*' to represent any beam.

   *<dis-beam-parameter-index-value>*
     The assigned value in range of [1, 65534] for the 'beam parameter index 'field in the DIS emissions PDU to be output by WSF.

.. command:: beam_function <sensor-type> <sensor-mode-name> <sensor-beam-number> <dis-beam-function-enum-value>

   Specify the DIS Emissions PDU 'beam function' value associated with specified WSF systems that emit electromagnetic energy (e.g., sensors). This is applicable only for outbound electromagnetic emission PDUs.

   *<sensor-type>*
      The type name of the sensor.

   *<sensor-mode-name>*
      The mode name of interest for the given sensor type. Use '*' to represent any mode.

   *<sensor-beam-number>*
      The beam number in the range of [1, 255] of interest for the given mode on the sensor type. Use '*' to represent any beam.

   *<dis-beam-parameter-index-value>*
      The value in range of [1, 255] for the 'beam function' field in the DIS emissions PDU to be output by WSF. If beam_function is not specified by the user, then the WSF implementation is allowed to set the index value to 5.

.. command:: entity_id <platform_name> <entity-number>

   Assign a specific DIS entity number to a WSF platform instance. If no DIS entity number is specified for a given platform instance, the simulation will automatically assign one sequentially, in creation order, (see start_entity). The unique DIS entity ID for a platform is formed by combining the values of  site_, application_ and *entity number*.

   Example::

    site           79
    application    22
    entity_id      737-1   101
    entity_id      787-1   102

   This input results in assignment of the DIS entity ID {79:22:101} to the WSF platform instance named '737-1', and an assignment of {79:22:102} to the WSF platform instance named '787-1'.

.. command:: start_entity <dis-entity>

   Specify the starting DIS entity in the range [0, 65534]. The simulation will assign DIS entity IDs to DIS platform representations sequentially, in creation order, beginning with this value for the start_entity.

   Example::

    site          79
    application   22
    start_entity  10

   This input results in the simulation's assigning a DIS entity ID of {79:22:10} to the first 'local' DIS representation it creates.  The next one will have an ID of {79:22:11}, followed by {79:22:12}, etc.

   **Default:** 1

   .. note::
      These assignments are overridden by entity_id_ designations.

.. command:: private  [ name <name> | type <type> | category <category> | all ]

   Indicate that locally owned platforms of the specified name, type, or :command:`platform.category` are to be considered 'private' and not written to the DIS network.

.. _dis_interface.Filtering_Commands:

Filtering commands
==================

.. command:: filter_out_by_site_and_app

   Filter out a site and application pair when running in a DIS environment.  The site and application must be set up as a pair.  Repeat the entire block for multiple site/application pairs.

   ::

    filter_out_by_site_and_app
       ignore_site 80
       ignore_application 200
    end_filter_out_by_site_and_app

.. command:: ignore_kind_and_domain <kind> <domain>

   Filter out DIS entity state PDUs with given DIS entity type kind and domain values. Use of this filter will prevent creation of the corresponding external platforms in the simulation. For example, to filter out all entity state PDUs from land-based platforms (kind = 1; domain = 1):

    ignore_kind_and_domain 1 1

.. command:: ignore_type <dis_entity_type>

   Filter out DIS entity state PDUs of the given DIS entity type.  Use of this filter will prevent creation of the corresponding external platforms in the simulation. For example, to filter out all F-15Es in the simulation:

    ignore_type 1:2:225:1:5:5:0  // See DIS enumeration document for DIS entity types listing

.. command:: ignore_pdu_type <string>

   Filter out DIS PDUs of a given type. For instance, to filter out the Stop/Freeze and Signal PDUs::

    ignore_pdu_type Stop/Freeze
    ignore_pdu_type signal

.. command:: filter_out_by_range <platform-name> <length-value>

   Filter out DIS entity state PDUs based on a given range from a platform.  Entities beyond the given range(s) will not be added to the simulation.  Multiple platforms may be specified. For example, to filter out all platforms outside a 60 km radius from two 737 platforms, named 737_1A and 737_1B::

    filter_out_by_range 737_1A 60 km
    filter_out_by_range 737_1B 60 km

.. _dis_interface.Other_Commands:

Other Commands
==============

.. command:: debug_emission_pdu <level>

   Specify the level of debugging information for electromagnetic emission PDUs.

   **Default:** 0

.. command:: enumerate entity_types to <target-name>
             enumerate emitter_types to <target-name>

    * entity_types:
      Outputs the list of platform types and the entity_type_ each one maps to.
    * entity_types:
      Outputs the list of sensor emitter types and the emitter_type_ each one maps to.
    * <target-name*> : Defines where the listing is output.  If *<target-name>* is STDOUT, the listing is printed to the
      console.  Otherwise *<target-name>* is interpreted as a file name and written to a file.

   .. warning::
      This command should be used after all platform types and entity_type commands have been processed.

.. command:: log_created_entities

   Specify that information concerning the creation of DIS entities is to be written to standard output. This is useful for debugging.  It is also used to create a DIS entity ID table in conjunction with the make_entity_id_map.pl perl script (located under the tools subdirectory).

.. command:: no_periodic_pdus_while_paused

   Will cause entity state and emission PDUs not to be sent while the simulation is paused.  This is default behavior.

   **Default:** off (not sent)

.. command:: multi_thread

   Creates a worker thread, separate from the main thread, that sends/receives DIS PDUs. Use this capability in a multi-threaded frame step simulation. This feature is not applicable for event-based simulations.

.. command:: multi_thread_sleep_time <time-value>

   Allows the user to explicitly set the time in seconds in which the DIS worker thread will sleep when it is not working.

   **Default:** 0.001 sec or one millisecond

.. command:: max_allowed_bad_entity_states <integer-value>

   Specify the number of "bad" DIS entity state PDUs that will be allowed before future PDUs from an entity are suppressed.  A bad entity state PDU includes one or more of the following bad data:

   * The location is below the lowest possible point under the ocean
   * The speed is > 45 km / s
   * The acceleration is > 10000 g

   **Default:** 5

.. command:: send_periodic_pdus_while_paused

   Will cause entity state and emission PDUs to be sent while the simulation is paused.  This change was implemented as external simulations are permitted to time out and remove remote entities if state PDUs are not received for a specified time.

   **Default:** off (not sent)

.. command:: suppress_non_standard_data <boolean-value> (deprecated)

   If this is set to 'true', WSF will only output standard DIS data.

.. command:: suppress_comm_data <boolean-value>

   Specify if Transmitter, Signal, and Receiver PDUs should be written for communications events. This should be set to true if communications PDUs are not important.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: suppress_emissions_data <boolean-value>

   Specify if Emissions PDUs should be written for sensor events. This should be set to true if emissions PDUs are not important.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: use_simple_accelerations

   If present, sets the acceleration fields in the DIS Entity State PDU using a simple rate change calculation equation. The related keywords that can be used to set the orientations rates are :command:`dis_interface.use_simple_orientation_rates`, :command:`dis_interface.use_body_angular_velocities`, and :command:`dis_interface.zero_body_angular_velocities`.  By default, if no related keywords are present, orientation rate values for psi, theta, and phi angles are set using the 'use_simple_orientation_rates' calculations. To override this behavior use one of the related keywords.

   ::

          v1 - v0
    a =  ---------
          t1 - t0

   This entry must be present for acceleration and orientation rate data to be computed and entered into the DIS Entity State PDU. If omitted the acceleration and orientation rate fields are set to '0'. If present, the default behavior uses the 'use_simple_orientation_rates' calculations for the orientation rates.

   **Default:** Entry Omitted

.. command:: use_simple_orientation_rates

   If present, uses a simple rate calculation to set the orientation rate fields in the DIS Entity State PDU. This is the default behavior.  If the entry is omitted, the fields will still be set using this simple rate calculation.  To override this behavior, use either keyword, 'use_body_angular_velocities' or 'zero_body_angular_velocities'.

   ::

            psi1 - psi0
    apsi =  -----------, etc...
              t1 - t0

   **Default:** Entry Omitted

.. command:: use_body_angular_velocities

   If present, uses DIS standard world to body calculations to set the DIS Entity State's orientation rate fields. If omitted, the simple orientation rate :command:`calculation <dis_interface.use_simple_orientation_rates>`, is used in the DIS Entity State's orientation rate fields.  However, if present, this keyword will override both the 'use_simple_orientation_rates' and the 'zero_body_angular_velocities' keyword behaviors. ::

      // convert world (Euler) angular velocities to body axis angular velocities (as per standard)
      w1 = (delta phi/dt) - ((delta yaw/dt) * sin(theta))
      w2 = (delta theta/dt)*cos(phi) + ((delta psi/dt)*sin(phi)*cos(theta))
      w3 = -((delta theta/dt)*sin(phi) + ((delta psi/dt)*cos(phi)*cos(theta))

   **Default:** Entry Omitted

.. command:: zero_body_angular_velocities

   If present, zeroes out the DIS Entity State's orientation rate fields. Will override the 'use_simple_orientation_rates' calculations. Will not override the 'use_body_angular_velocities' behavior if both keywords are present. 
   **Default:** Entry Omitted

.. _dis_interface.External_DIS_Mover_Commands:

External DIS Mover Commands
===========================

.. command:: map_external_entity <dis-entity-id>

   An incoming DIS entity ID will be checked against the dis entity type to platform type mapping.  If there is a corresponding platform type, all components defined for that type will be available to the external platform. The external platform will be treated as a local platform within WSF and its components can then be controlled or monitored as with any WSF platform. Any component capable of sending DIS PDUs from WSF will send DIS PDUs, with the exception of the DIS Entity State PDU, which is not sent. The PDUs will have the external platform's entity ID in their dis-entity-id field.

.. command:: map_external_type <dis-entity-type>

   Same as map_external_entity_ command, except it will map all entities of the given dis-entity-type rather than a specific DIS entity ID.
