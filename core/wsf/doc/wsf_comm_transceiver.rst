.. note::

      :model:`WSF_COMM_XMTR <WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER>` and :model:`WSF_COMM_RCVR <WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER>` are transmit-only
      and receive-only versions of :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER`.

Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER` provides a baseline perfect/wired implementation that is capable of both transmitting and receiving. If a communication device is required to transmit or receive only, the :model:`WSF_COMM_XMTR <WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER>` and :model:`WSF_COMM_RCVR <WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER>` types are available.  Both of these types are special cases of the :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER` type and therefore share the same commands that are listed below in the command section.

This model is the baseline capability of communications in AFSIM. It has no additional capabilities beyond what is provided in the :command:`comm` Commands, which is the typical set of capability provided in AFSIM. 

For a more detailed look on how baseline communications work, see :doc:`analyst_ocd/communications_primer`.
