Overview
========

WSF_VARIABLE_RATE_FUEL is a fuel consumption rate model.  This class defines fuel consumption behavior, at either
constant rates, or at variable rates based upon one or two independent variables (the choices are platform altitude and
speed).  By default, one fuel table is accepted, independent of fuel mode.  However, multiple tables may be defined for
different fuel modes, if supplied, and the active table will be switched by setting the fuel mode.  (This model differs
from the similar :model:`WSF_TABULAR_RATE_FUEL` in that :model:`WSF_VARIABLE_RATE_FUEL` input format is more flexible, and need
not be rectangular.  :model:`WSF_TABULAR_RATE_FUEL` should be preferred for allowing for up to three independent variables,
but :model:`WSF_VARIABLE_RATE_FUEL` is maintained for backward compatibility with several legacy applications.)

Commands
========

.. command:: table_for_mode <mode-name>

    Indicates that the following rate definitions are for the named mode. Modes are typically used to specify the rate of
    consumption for various configurations (e.g., 'cruise'). The user is responsible for changing modes either through the
    script interface or from custom code.  If this command is not supplied then the rate definitions apply universally, and
    fuel mode is ignored.

.. command:: rates ... end_rates
    :block:

    .. parsed-literal::

        rates
          altitude_ ...
            speed_ ...
            .
            .
          altitude_ ...
          .
          .
        end_rates

    .. command:: altitude <length-value>

       Specifies the altitude that the subsequent speed_ data is valid for.  The altitude blocks must be in increasing
       numerical order.  The consumption rate will be computed using a linear interpolation on the current altitude.

    .. command:: speed <length-value> rate <mass-flow-value>

        Specifies the speed that the listed consumption rate is valid for.  The speed entries must be in increasing numerical
        order.  The consumption rate will be computed using a linear interpolation on the current altitude and speed.
