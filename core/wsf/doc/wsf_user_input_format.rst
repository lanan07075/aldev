.. _WSF_User_Input_Format:

WSF User Input Format
-----------------------

Command Format
==============

Commands are of the form::

 command [argument1 argument2 ]

Commands and arguments are separated by one or more "white-space' characters (below):

* Blank
* Tab
* Carriage return
* New line

There is no explicit command terminator.  Each command has its own termination condition (i.e., either processing a
fixed number of arguments or recognition of a certain word).

There is no limit on the length of a line other than any limit imposed by the operating system, which is typically
greater than 1,000 characters.

A command may be split across multiple lines (by virtue of the fact that a carriage return and a new line are
separators) or multiple commands may be stacked on one line (by virtue of the fact that there is no explicit command
terminator).

.. _WSF_User_Input_Format.Pre-Processor:

Pre-Processor
=============

The pre-processor allows for arbitrary text substitution by defining variables and referencing the variables later.  A
variable is defined as follows::

 $define X 123
 $define MULTILINE_VARIABLE \
    A backslash at the end of line \
    will allow multiline variable \
    definitions

.. note:: the '$define' command must begin at the start of the line.

Then use the variable like this::

 end_time $<X>$ seconds

When using a variable, a default value is allowed.

.. note:: 

   Providing a default value is good practice, as not providing a default value will prevent tools like Wizard from parsing the input file.

Therefore, a **preferred** variable usage looks like this::

 end_time $<X:1000>$ seconds

If the variable X is not defined, the default of 1000 is used instead.

Using pre-processor variables should be unnecessary for most tasks in WSF, and <u>should be avoided where
possible</u>.  Pre-processor variables are particularly well-suited to assist in design of experiments.

Details:

* Empty variables will expand to a single space
* Variables present in another variable's definition will be expanded.  ex:

::

 $define SIDE      blue
 $define SET_SIDE  side $<SIDE>$
 
* Any given file is only preprocessed once, and on the first pass.  using 'include' to read the same file twice will
  not preprocess the file in different contexts
* Variables need to be defined before being used.

Comments
========

#, // - Single line comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "#' and "//' character(s) cause the character and all following characters on a line to be ignored.  If a comment
follows a command or argument then there must be at least one white-space character before the "#'.  A stand-alone
comment does not require a space before the "#'.

/\* \*\/ - Comment block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sequence "\/\*" causes ALL characters from the "\/\*" up to and including the character sequence "\*\/" to be ignored.
The sequence can extend over multiple lines.

Block comments cannot be nested, which means the FIRST occurrence of the sequence "\/\*" will terminate the block comment.
