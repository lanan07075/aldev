    :model:`WSF_TABULAR_ATTENUATION` is an :command:`attenuation_model` that allows the user to define attenuation
    using a table.

.. command:: attenuation <table-value>
   
   Specifies a table that defines the attenuation values. The table must be a function of at least three independent
   variables:

   * altitude, elevation_angle and slant_range
   * altitude_1, altitude_2 and ground_range

   It may additionally include 'frequency' as an additional independent variable.
   
   Default: none (must be specified)

.. command:: adjustment_factor <value>
   
   Specifies a multiplier to be applied to returned values. This would typically be used to account for the fact that
   values integrated over a wide band (i.e.: visual) represent an average that may include many 'dead-zones'
   that the sensor may exclude. Thus, the effective transmittance may be higher.

   .. note:: The return values are transmittance, so to increase transmittance specify a factor greater than one.
   
   Default: 1.0 (no adjustment)

.. command:: sort_end_points <boolean-value>
   
   Specifies end-points (source and target points) for a given interaction can be logically interchanged so the path goes
   from the highest object to the lowest object. This would be applicable if the attenuation values are independent of
   direction. This would allow a table to be computed for air-to-ground purposes to also be used for ground-to-air
   purposes.
   
   Default: false

.. command:: two_way_attenuation <boolean-value>
   
   Specifies if the table values represent two-way attenuation (transmitter-to-target-to-receiver).
   
   Default: false (the table values represent one-way attenuation)

.. command:: spectral_data_conversion ... end_spectral_data_conversion
   
   This command is used to convert spectral data produced by a program like MODTRAN into a form that can be used as input
   for the attenuation_ command.
   
   This command is used separately from the actual run of a simulation that employs the model. For instance, one would
   first convert the file executing the following input within mission:
   
   .. parsed-literal::

    :command:`attenuation_model` CONVERT :model:`WSF_TABULAR_ATTENUATION`
       spectral_data_conversion_
          sensor_to_target_transmittance_ example_stt.plt
          output_                         example.txt
       end_spectral_data_conversion
    end_attenuation_model
   
   The resulting converted data would then be used as an attenuation model in a sensor:
   
   .. parsed-literal::

     :command:`attenuation_model` EXAMPLE :model:`WSF_TABULAR_ATTENUATION`
        attenuation_ file example.txt
     end_attenuation_model

   .. command:: sensor_to_target_transmittance <filename>
   
   Specifies the name of the file which contains the raw spectral sensor-to-target transmittance as a function of observer
   altitude and elevation angle and slant range to the target. Using the current processes, this file name will be of the
   form *<filename>_stt.plt*.
   
   Default: none - this is required.

.. command:: target_to_background_radiance <filename>
   
   Specifies the name of the file which contains the raw spectral target-to-background radiance as a function of observer
   altitude and elevation angle and slant range to the target. Using the current processes, this file name will be of the
   form *<filename>_tbr.plt*.
   
   If this file is NOT provided, the output will simply contain the integrated transmittance for each point. If the file
   is provided then the output will contain the 'line-of-sight atmospheric transmittance' or 'contrast transmittance'
   needed by some sensor models.
   
   Default: none - the output contains the integrate transmittance.

.. command:: spectral_response_curve  ... end_spectral_response_curve
   
   This defines the response of the sensor as a function of wavelength. The curve is defined as a series of points where
   each point is defined as::
   
      wavelength response
   
   where the first item is the wavelength (with units) and the second item is the response for that wavelength. The
   response must be in the range [0 .. 1]. At least two points must be specified and the points must be in monotonically
   ascending of wavelength.
   
   Default: Uniform response of 1.0 for all wavelengths contained in the input files

.. command:: output <filename>
   
   Specifies the name of the file to which the converted results are to be written. The file can be used at the argument
   for the attenuation_ command (See the example at the start of the section.)
   
   Default: none - must be provided.
