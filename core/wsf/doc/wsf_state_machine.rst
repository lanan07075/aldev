Overview
========

WSF_STATE_MACHINE uses the concept of a finite state machine.  The user defines a set of transition rules that define
the conditions under which a transition can occur from one state to another. The transition rules are defined using the
:ref:`WSF scripting language <script>`. Similar to the :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`, the WSF_STATE_MACHINE does not have
direct access to tracks; hence, the TRACK variable **cannot** be used.

Commands
========

.. command:: show_state_evaluations

   Indicates that information about state evaluations should be written to standard output. This essentially shows the
   true or false status of the evaluation of each next_state block.

.. command:: show_state_transitions

   Indicates that information about state transitions should be written to standard output.

.. command:: state <state-name>

   Defines a state in a state machine with the name <state-name>.  Besides transition conditions, notice a state can have
   its own :command:`behavior_tree` inside.

   .. parsed-literal::

      state <state-name>
        on_entry
           ...
        end_on_entry
        on_exit
           ...
        end_on_exit
        next_state <next-state-name-1>
           ...
        end_next_state
        next_state <next-state-name-n>
           ...
        end_next_state
        behavior_tree
            :command:`behavior_tree` Commands ...
        end_behavior_tree
    end_state

Script Interface
================

:model:`WSF_STATE_MACHINE` utilizes the capabilities of the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface` and :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`.
