Command Chains
--------------

Explicit Command Chains
=======================
   
   A chain of command can be used by decision making routines to determine to whom orders can be
   issued and where reports should be sent. A command chain is constructed using the :command:`platform.commander`
   and :command:`platform.command_chain` commands on individual platforms.

   Command chains consist of commanders, subordinates, and peers.  Each command chain must have at least one commander
   (even if that commander is yourself).  By building up layers of commanders using this input, a complex, multilayered
   hierarchy can be created.

   :command:`Comm<comm>` devices use command chains to send messages to recipients (see :ref:`external_links <External_Link_Commands>`).
   In the case of a commander, this is a single recipient; whereas in the case of peers and subordinates, there
   may be zero, one, or many recipients.

   .. note::
      A platform may be a member of more than one chain of command, but may only be a member of each command chain once.

   Example::

     In this example there are two command chains:  ATC and AIRLINERS.
     On the AIRLINERS command chain, 737-1, 737-2 and 737-3 report to 737-cmd-1 who reports to joint-cmdr.
     In addition, 737-3 has a dual role and reports directly to the joint-cmdr on the ATC command chain.
     platform joint-cmdr COMMAND_POST
       command_chain ATC SELF
       command_chain AIRLINERS SELF
     end_platform
     platform 737-cmd-1 COMMAND_POST
        command_chain AIRLINERS joint-cmdr
        end_platform
     platform 737-1 F-18
        command_chain AIRLINERS 737-cmd-1
        end_platform
     platform 737-2 F-18
        command_chain AIRLINERS 737-cmd-1
        end_platform
     platform 737-3 F-18
        command_chain AIRLINERS 737-cmd-1
        command_chain ATC joint-cmdr
     end_platform

Default Command Chain
=====================

   The default command chain can be constructed using the :command:`platform.commander` command, using the :command:`platform.command_chain`
   command with a command chain name of "default", or implicitly constructed.  In the case where the default command chain is explicitly
   constructed, its behavior is the same as other explicitly constructed command chains.
   
   An implicitly constructed default command chain occurs when an explicit command chain is specified but no default command chain is specified.
   If a platform is a member of exactly one named (non-default) command chain, the platform will have the same commander on the default command chain.
   If a platform is a member of more than one named command chain, the commander on the default command chain will be a commander from one of the
   named command chains.  Which commander is chosen is not guaranteed and therefore, it is not recommended to use an implicitly constructed command
   chain along with multiple named command chains. 
   
   .. note::
      It is suggested to use named command chains over the implicitly constructed default command chain when a scenario consists of more than one command chain.

   .. deprecated:: 2.9
      Usage of an implicitly constructed default command chain is deprecated and will be unsupported in a future release, as this behavior leads to
      ambiguity when multiple named command chains exist.
