Overview
--------

A route_network_ is typically used to represent a network of roads, airways, or waterways.  It is generally used by objects such as :command:`air_traffic`, :command:`road_traffic`, and :command:`sea_traffic` to define the paths on which the platforms navigate or move.

.. note:: A :command:`route` must have at least two waypoints defined to be added to the route_network_.

Commands
--------

.. command:: use_route <route-name>

   Include the route type with the specified name as part of the route definition. Repeat as required to specify the route network.

.. command:: test

   During initialization, *test* all possible paths between each :command:`route.node_id` in all :command:`route`'s to solve the shortest path.  A count of *Nodes* in the route_network_ tested is output to the console.  See `Example 1 - route_network with test command`_.
   
   .. note:: A *Warning* is provided in the output when the shortest path cannot be solved between each start and end node path tested.  See `Example 2 - route_network with test command - cannot solve the shortest path`_.

   .. tip:: Use verbose_ to generate additional debugging data when using the test_ command.

.. command:: test_nodes <from-node-id> <to-node-id>

   During initialization, test all routes to solve the shortest path between *<from-node-id>* and *<to-node-id>* (specified as integers).
   
   The following data is output to the console:
   
   * From: <from-node-id>
   * To: <to-node-id>
   * Cost: (computed cost value of the tested path)
   * Path: (list of :command:`route.node_id`'s included in the tested path)
   
   See `Example 3 - route_network with test_nodes command`_.
   
   .. note:: When the path cannot be solved, *Cost: = -1* and *Path:* is empty.

.. command:: verbose

   Generates additional debug data when used with the test_ command.  The following data is output to the console for each path tested:
   
   * From: <from-node-id>
   * To: <to-node-id>
   * Cost: (computed cost value of the tested path)
   * Path: (list of :command:`route.node_id`'s included in the tested path)

   See `Example 4 - route_network with test and verbose commands`_.

   .. note:: The shortest path cannot be solved when a disconnection is detected in the route(s) to the target node.  When the shortest path cannot be solved, a *Warning* is provided, *Cost: = -1* and *Path: = No path could be found.*  See `Example 5 - test command with verbose - cannot solve the shortest path`_.
