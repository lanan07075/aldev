Overview
========

When placed on a platform, the WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER provides for a smooth motion in both horizontal and vertical
directions. Unlike the :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`, vertical acceleration is modeled; transitions in both altitude and bearing
are performed dynamically and at the same time.  Similar to the WSF_AIR_MOVER, no aerodynamics, mass properties, or
propulsion are required to be known in order to use this mover.  In addition, flight characteristics are not affected
by various flight altitudes of a platform with this mover definition (no air density variation effect).

This mover type accepts two different values for gain (velocity_pursuit_gain_ and
proportional_navigation_gain_), and some clarifying comments are in order.  The "correct" gain values for your
particular scenario are truly implementation-defined, and no particular default values will work for all scenarios. 
Higher values result in a more aggressive maneuver to intercept, with more angular, discontinuous trajectory turns,
while a lower value tends toward a slow, wandering maneuver into the aimpoint.  The mover algorithms are written to be
general purpose enough to intercept a dynamically maneuvering aimpoint, and in such a situation, it is best to use
proportional_navigation gain for a more efficient use of energy during the intercept.  However, this mover type should
always be given at least a small amount of velocity pursuit gain, because there are instances when the turn
direction of the proportional navigation becomes ambiguous, and may lead to flying 180 degrees from the desired
aimpoint; some velocity pursuit gain will step in when needed, to supply the turn direction.  If "wing-rocking" is
observed, then the gain values should probably be reduced.

Note that as with all mover types, slight timing differences during waypoint approaches will cause path-to-path
variability when many platforms are following the same set of waypoints.  Tightening up the update intervals will
mitigate this issue, but with increased run times.  Testing has shown that reducing update_interval from 1.0 second to
0.01 second greatly reduces this tendency, for example.

Also note that there is no logic devoted to maintaining a constant altitude.  Consider a two-waypoint ping-pong route: 
When waypoint A is reached, there are an infinite number of 180-degree turn options (in 3-D) to get back to waypoint B;
which could include an Immelmann turn, a lateral turn right or left, a rolling split-S, or anything in between.  The
best course of action here is to assure that there are enough points in the assigned route, and spaced closely enough,
to inform the mover what altitudes to fly.

.. note::

   The WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER cannot completely replace the WSF_AIR_MOVER. Several scripting and route methods
   available to the WSF_AIR_MOVER are not available to the WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER. The WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER should be
   considered initial capability and by no means complete. It does not implement all guidance commands while switching
   waypoints within a :ref:`Route` ..end_route definition.  It does honor the route commands of Latitude, Longitude,
   Altitude (MSL-only) and Speed commands.  However, it currently ignores distance, time, climb rates, and flight path
   angles.

The underlying dynamics model of the WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER is essentially a quaternion orientation mathematics model that
is permitted to rotate within constrained angular rates in inertial space while the velocity vector is directed in the
"forward" direction. The magnitude of the accelerations are determined by internal pursuit and proportional navigation
gains, and the target point (waypoint) in three dimensions is determined by the :ref:`Route_Mover` waypoint-switching
logic.  The current fly-to-point is advanced to the next (L,L,A) in the route when the platform is within one
turn-radius of the current waypoint.  The waypoint_switch_on_ground_turning_radius_ flag affects what value is
considered one "turn-radius".

Velocity vector turn rates are constrained to the most restrictive of maximum_lateral_acceleration,
maximum_body_roll_rate_, and maximum_body_turn_rate_, and ever increasing current platform speed will force
the platform motion to approach a straight line if maximum_lateral_acceleration is held constant.

Adjusting the default velocity_pursuit_gain_ (VP) and proportional_navigation_gain_ (PN) values are not
trivial.  These two gains directly conflict with each other, and achieving proper values may become a trial and error
process.  "Saturation" may occur if velocity vector constraints (see paragraph above) are so severe that the requested
VP or PN requested accelerations are not achievable.  Setting VP and PN to zero values would result in a platform not
turning at all to intercept a waypoint.  To adjust VP and PN gain values, start by setting PN to zero, and VP to a
small value.  Keep increasing VP until turn aggressiveness toward a waypoint is sufficient to intercept.  If the target
point is stationary (such as for a fixed waypoints), calibration is complete.  However, for moving or accelerating
targets, pure VP will result in a sweeping turn to approach the target from behind.  Increasing PN until the platform
"anticipates" the impact point, and flies to intercept in a straight line (provided the target is also moving in a
straight line).  Setting PN with no VP results in flying away from the target if the target point begins behind the
velocity vector (azimuth or elevation greater than 90 degrees). Generally, a brief period of VP is flown to get the
platform moving toward the target, and then VP is ramped out, while PN is ramped in, so terminal intercept is pure PN. 
The default values of a VP of 4 and PN of 40 should suffice in most cases.

(Only of interest to software developers, the :model:`WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER` underlying motion dynamics are implemented by the
UtMath3D_Motion utility, which processes the input stream commands below.)

.. block:: WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER

Commands
========

.. command:: detailed_debug <boolean-value>
   
   Enables debug output to the standard output.

.. command:: prefer_canopy_up <boolean-value>
   
   Causes the platform to roll to the local vertical at all times.  Mutually exclusive to bank_to_turn_.

.. command:: bank_to_turn <boolean-value>
   
   Causes the platform to roll into the acceleration vector, but still prefers the vertical when not accelerating in a
   turn.  Mutually exclusive to prefer_canopy_up_.

.. command:: broach_at_sea_level <boolean-value>
   
   This mover was originally developed to define a torpedo mover. However, the capability of the model is such that it can
   be used above sea level.  This flag assures that the motion must remain below local sea level, once subsurface.

.. command:: target_speed <speed-value>
   
   Once supplied, the platform will accelerate or decelerate to match the target (desired) speed, subject to
   maximum_linear_acceleration_ constraint.

.. command:: initial_speed <speed-value>
   
   Initial linear speed.  After initialization, speed is varied to maintain target_speed_.

.. command:: initial_flight_path_angle <angle-value>
   
   Initial flight path angle.  After initialization, flight path angle will vary to guide to a desired waypoint in a
   defined route.

.. command:: maximum_linear_acceleration <acceleration-value>
   
   Defines the linear (velocity direction) acceleration limit constraint.
   
   Default: 0.25 G

.. command:: maximum_radial_acceleration <acceleration-value>
   
   Defines the radial (normal to velocity direction) acceleration limit constraint.  This constraint is imposed
   simultaneously with maximum_body_turn_rate_, the most restrictive is used.
   
   Default: 8.0 G

.. command:: maximum_body_roll_rate <angular-rate-value>
   
   Defines the maximum rate at which the platform will try to capture desired target bank angle.
   
   Default: 180 deg/sec

.. command:: maximum_body_turn_rate <angular-rate-value>
   
   Defines the maximum rate at which the velocity vector will rotate in three-dimensional space.  This constraint is
   imposed simultaneously with maximum_radial_acceleration_, the most restrictive is used.
   
   Default: 45 deg/sec

.. command:: velocity_pursuit_gain <non-negative-value>
   
   Defines the factor of proportion between target azimuth and elevation (in radians), and the applied lateral or vertical

   Default: 4.0

.. command:: waypoint_switch_on_ground_turning_radius <boolean-value>
   
   If this input value is set to true, only horizontal offsets are considered when deciding to advance to the next
   waypoint in a route; vertical miss values are ignored.  If set false, then a 3-dimensional slant offset is considered
   when deciding if a waypoint is sufficiently close to be considered "hit".
   
   Default: true

.. command:: proportional_navigation_gain <non-negative-value>
   
   Defines the factor of proportion between the target line-of-sight-rate (in rad/sec), and the applied lateral or
   vertical acceleration (in m/sec^2) to null the velocity vector to intercept the target's future position at time of
   intercept.  See comments in header above.
   
   Default: 40.0

.. command:: use_route <route-name>
   
   Supplies the name of the route to follow. The route is assumed to be a predefined absolute route.
