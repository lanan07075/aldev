Set
---

.. class:: Set<T> inherits Object
   :constructible:
   :container:
   :cloneable:

:class:`Set\<T\>` is a container type that stores a sorted set of unique elements of type T. For example, Set<int> is a set of integers. It is similar to the C++ STL set.

.. tip::

   The elements of a Set are sorted using the ordering defined on its value type (T). With a few exceptions, :ref:`script classes <docs/script:Script Classes>` have no defined ordering, and using them as the value type will result in non-determinism when iterating over the elements of the Set. It is recommended in these use cases to store only :ref:`basic types<docs/script:Basic Types>` or a script class with a defined ordering (e.g. :class:`WsfTrackId`) in the set. For example:

   * Store the integer platform index, rather than :class:`WsfPlatform`, and lookup the platform using :method:`WsfSimulation.FindPlatform`.
   * Store the track id, rather than :class:`WsfLocalTrack`, and lookup the track from the platform's track manager.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int Size()
   
   Returns the current number of elements in the set.

.. method:: bool Empty()
   
   Returns true if there are no elements in the set.

.. method:: bool Erase(T aData)
   
   Erases the specified set element.

.. method:: void Clear()
   
   Clears the set.

.. method:: bool Exists(T aData)
   
   Returns true if the specified set element exists.

.. method:: void Insert(T aData)
   
   Inserts an element into the set.

.. method:: Set<T> Union(Set<T> aSet)
   
   Returns a Set that is the union of the two Sets. For example, {1, 2, 3} union {3, 4, 5} produces {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

.. method:: Set<T> Difference(Set<T> aSet)
   
   Returns a Set that is the difference of the two Sets. For example, {1, 2, 3} difference {3, 4, 5} produces {1, 2}.

.. method:: Set<T> Intersection(Set<T> aSet)
   
   Returns a Set that is the intersection of the two Sets. For example, {1, 2, 3} intersection {3, 4, 5} produces {3}.

.. method:: SetIterator GetIterator()
   
   Returns an iterator that points to the beginning of the set. This is used by the script language to support the :ref:`foreach<docs/script:\<foreach-loop\>>` command, but may also be used directly.
