WsfPolygonalFieldOfView
-----------------------

.. class:: WsfPolygonalFieldOfView inherits WsfFieldOfView
   :cloneable:

:class:`WsfPolygonalFieldOfView` defines a :ref:`polygonal field of view<field_of_view_commands.polygonal>` that is used to dynamically change a sensor's field of view (originally defined using :command:`antenna field of view commands<field_of_view>`) using :method:`WsfSensor.SetFOV`.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: static WsfPolygonalFieldOfView Construct(Array<Array<double>> aAzElPoints)
   
   Returns a new :class:`WsfPolygonalFieldOfView` object defined with the specified azimuth and elevation points (in degrees).

   Example::

    // Create a polygonal field of view consisting of three (az, el) pairs forming a triangle-shaped frustrum
    double az = 5.0; // deg
    double el = 5.0; // deg
    Array<Array<double>> points = {};
    Array<double> point1 = {};
    point1.PushBack(-az);
    point1.PushBack(el);
    points.PushBack(point1);
    Array<double> point2 = {};
    point2.PushBack(0.0);
    point2.PushBack(-el);
    points.PushBack(point2);
    Array<double> point3 = {};
    point3.PushBack(az);
    point3.PushBack(el);
    points.PushBack(point3);
    WsfPolygonalFieldOfView pfov = WsfPolygonalFieldOfView.Construct(points);

   .. note:: At least three (azimuth, elevation) points must be defined in a valid polygonal field of view.

Methods
=======

.. method:: Array<Array<double>> AzElPoints()

   Returns the array of (azimuth, elevation) pairs (in degrees) that define the points of the polygonal field of view.
