.. class:: WsfObject  

Methods
=======

.. method:: string Name()
   
   Returns the object's name as a string.
   
   .. parsed-literal::

      script void PrintPlatformName(WsfPlatform aPlatform)
        WsfPlatform mMyPlatform = PLATFORM;
        writeln("The platform\'s name is ", aPlatform.Name());
        writeln("The platform\'s name is ", mMyPlatform.Name());
      end_script

.. method:: string Type()
   
   Returns the object's type as a string.

   .. parsed-literal::

      script void PrintPlatformType(WsfPlatform aPlatform)
        writeln("The platform\'s type is ", PLATFORM.Type());
      end_script
   
.. method:: string BaseType()

   Returns the object's base type as a string. The base type of an object is the type from which the object derives.

.. method:: bool IsA_TypeOf(string aType)
   
   Returns true if aType is an ancestor of the object.

.. method:: bool IsValid()
   
   Returns true if the object reference does indeed refer to a valid object. Many methods may return "null' references if
   the requested object does not exist (e.g., :method:`PLATFORM.Sensor('radar-1') <WsfPlatform.Sensor>` will return a "null
   reference' if the platform does not have a sensor with the name 'radar-1'). This method allows you to test a reference
   to make sure it is "valid' (not "null') before attempting to use it.
   
   .. parsed-literal::

      execute at_time 0.1 seconds relative
        WsfPlatform commander = PLATFORM.Commander();
        if (commander.IsValid() && commander.CategoryMemberOf("ATC_COMM"))
        {
          cEVALUATE_EMCON_TURN_OFF = true;
        }
      end_execute

.. method:: bool ProcessInput(string aCommands)
   
   Call ProcessInput on the current object passing the current command(s).  Returns true if the command(s) were handled
   properly.

   .. warning:: This method may not work with all commands, especially post-initialization.
   
   .. parsed-literal::

      processor test WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR
        execute at_time 2 min relative
           WsfProcessor computer = PLATFORM.Processor("computer"); # must have a processor named "computer"
           computer.ProcessInput("g_bias 2.0");
           computer.ProcessInput("proportional_navigation_gain 6.0");
        end_execute
      end_processor
