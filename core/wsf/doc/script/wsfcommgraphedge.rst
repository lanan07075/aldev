WsfCommGraphEdge
----------------

.. class:: WsfCommGraphEdge

Description
===========

The :class:`WsfCommGraphEdge` represents an edge in a :class:`WsfCommGraph`. In the comm framework, graphs
are used to represent network states, routing tables, etc. An edge in such a graph is directional, and indicates
that communication is possible from the node (comm interface) in which the edge originates to the destination.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfAddress SourceAddress()

   Provides the source address for this edge. Since edges in comm graphs are directional, this address indicates
   the node (comm interface) from which this edge originates, and can successfully initiate communications.

.. method:: WsfAddress DestinationAddress()

   Provides the destination address for this edge. Since edges in comm graphs are directional, this address indicates
   the node (comm interface) that can successfully receive a communication.

.. method:: double Weight()

   Provides the weight, or the cost, associated with sending a message using the source and destination interface represented
   by this edge.

   Edge weights are typically 1 in most applications, where hop number is the desired pathing metric. The usage is usually
   dependent on routing protocol implementation, and can represent one or many factors in determination of the best path to
   a destination in the graph. However, lower values are always considered better for pathing determination.

.. method:: bool IsEnabled()

   Returns true if this edge is enabled, or false if this edge is disabled. Generally, edges that are disabled are not
   considered in pathing algorithms within the comm framework.
