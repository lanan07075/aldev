.. _WsfPlatform:

WsfPlatform
-----------

.. class:: WsfPlatform inherits WsfObject
   :arrow:

**Input type:** :model:`WSF_PLATFORM`

.. contents::
   :local:

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfRoute CreateRoute(string aRouteName)

   Returns a clone of the route with the given name. The returned value will not be valid if the named route is not found.

.. method:: bool ExecuteGlobalScript(string aScript)

   Executes the script with the given name within the global context and returns true if successful.
   See :method:`WsfSimulation.Execute` for more methods to execute global scripts.

.. method:: static bool IsA_TypeOf(string aDerivedType, string aBaseType)

   Returns true if the platform type specified by *aDerivedType* inherits from the platform type specified by
   *aBaseType* (compare to :method:`WsfObject.IsA_TypeOf(aBaseType) <WsfObject.IsA_TypeOf>`, which determines if a specific
   object inherits from *aBaseType*).

General Methods
===============

.. method:: int Index()

   Returns the unique index of the platform within the simulation. A platform's index is constant, and a given index will never be reused during the course of the simulation.

.. method:: double CreationTime()

   Returns the simulation time (in seconds) when the platform was created.

   ::

      if (PLATFORM.CreationTime() > 60)
      {
        writeln("This platform was created at simulation time ", PLATFORM.CreationTime());
      }

.. method:: double TimeSinceCreation()

   Returns the elapsed time in seconds since the platform was created.

   ::

      writeln("It has been ", PLATFORM.TimeSinceCreation(), " seconds since this platform was created");

.. method:: void SetCreationTime(double aTime)

   Defines the simulation time in seconds when the platform is to be added to the simulation.

   .. note::
      This method is valid only during the execution of the simulation-scope :command:`on_platform_injection` script when the platform is being added to the simulation. Setting a value greater than the current simulation time defers the addition of the platform to the simulation until the specified time. The call is ignored if the value is less than the current simulation time.

.. method:: void SetSide(string aSide)

   Sets the platform's side.

   .. note::
      This method is only valid prior to adding the platform to the simulation.

.. method:: string Side()

   Returns the platform's side.

.. method:: void SetIcon(string aIcon)

   Sets the platform's icon.

.. method:: string Icon()

   Returns the platform's icon.

.. method:: bool IsExternallyControlled()

   Returns whether the platform is being controlled externally to the local simulation (as with an external :command:`dis_interface` entity).

.. method:: void Detonate(string aResult)

   Detonates the platform. The value of "aResult" must be one of the following or the detonation will be treated as a "dud":

      * target_impact
      * far_away_in_air
      * far_away_above_ground
      * far_away_ground_impact
      * target_proximity_air_burst
      * target_proximity_above_ground
      * target_proximity_ground_impact

.. method:: void DeletePlatform()

   Schedules the platform for deletion from the simulation. Since the deletion will occur after the current script context returns, any remaining commands in the script context will be executed.


.. _WsfPlatform.Command_Chain_Methods:

Command Chain Methods
=====================

.. method:: WsfPlatform Commander()
            WsfPlatform Commander(string aCommandChainName)

   Returns the platform's commander in the default command chain (first form) or the specified command chain (second form).

            void SetCommander(string aCommandChainName, WsfPlatform aPlatform)

   Sets the platform's commander in the default command chain (first form) or the specified command chain (second form). There is one issue with using this method.  Any links to a commander that transmit over a comm devices that uses the <local:slave> network_name will not work.  So if you plan on using this method to change a platform's commander during run-time, then do NOT use the <local:slave> network_name on the platform's comm devices.

.. method:: string CommanderName()
            string CommanderName(string aCommandChainName)

   Returns the platform's commander's name in the default command chain (first form) or the specified command chain (second form).

.. method:: double Width()
.. method:: double Height()

.. method:: double FuelMass()
.. method:: double PayloadMass()

   Returns the total mass (empty mass + fuel mass + payload mass) of the platform or one of the components (in kilograms). The masses may be defined directly using the :command:`platform.empty_mass`, :command:`platform.fuel_mass` and :command:`platform.payload_mass`, but the masses are sometimes defined in and maintained by the mover.

.. method:: int Appearance()

   Returns the platform's current 32-bit Appearance data as an integer excluding data for bits 3-4, 21 & 23. (See Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Entity Appearance field definitions.)

.. method:: void SetAppearance(int aLeastSignificantBit, int aNumberOfBits, int aValue)

   Sets the platform's 32-bit Appearance data excluding data for bits 3-4, 21 & 23. (See :command:`Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Entity Appearance <dis_interface>` field definitions.)

   .. note::
      This capability allows for direct manipulation of the Entity State Appearance data being reported.

   **Example**

   ::

    #  To set afterburner to on
    #  LSB=16; number of bits=1; value=1 for afterburner on
    PLATFORM.SetAppearance(16, 1, 1);
    ...
    #  To set configuration state
    # LSB=17; number of bits=4; value=15  // valid values in the range of [0..15]
     PLATFORM.SetAppearance(17, 4, 15);
    ...
    #  To set power-plant status to on

.. method:: void SetConcealmentFactor(double aConcealmentFactor)

   Sets the platform's concealment factor to a value within the range of [0..1], with 0 being visible and 1 being hidden. This value is used to determine the Entity State Appearance bit 19 for land domain platforms only. The SetAppearance function can also be used to set bit 19 directly.

.. method:: double DamageFactor()

   Returns the platform's current damage level (factor). The return value is in the range of [0..1], with 0 being undamaged and 1 being fully damaged or destroyed.

.. method:: void SetDamageFactor(double aDamageFactor)

.. method:: bool Indestructible()

   Returns 'true' if the platform is indestructible. A platform may be marked as indestructible in order prevent it from being destroyed. When this value is set 'true', any applied damage accumulates in a logarithmically decaying fashion, so DamageFactor(), rather than returning an actual damage state, reflects an ever decreasing (but never reaching zero) probability of survival.

.. method:: void SetIndestructible(bool aIsIndestructible)

   Sets the platform's indestructible attribute.

.. method:: void SetSignatureState(string aState)

   Sets the platform's infrared, optical and radar signature state to the given state.

.. method:: string InfraredSigState()

   Returns the current infrared signature state of the platform.

.. method:: void SetInfraredSigState(string aState)

   Sets the platform's infrared signature state to the given state.

.. method:: double InfraredSigScaleFactor()

   Returns the current infrared signature scale factor (as a linear value, not dB).

.. method:: void SetInfraredSigScaleFactor(double aScaleValue)

   Sets the infrared signature scale factor to the given value (as an linear value, not dB). The effective infrared signature of the platform becomes the baseline signature value multiplied by this value.

.. method:: double InfraredRadiantIntensity(WsfGeoPoint aViewer, double aEarthRadiusScale, string aBandName)

   Returns the infrared radiant intensity of the platform (in W/sr) when viewed from the location specified by *aViewer*.

   *aEarthRadiusScale* is a value that can be used to account for atmospheric refraction (typically 1.0). A value of less than or equal to zero is equivalent to specifying 1.0.

   *aBandName* is the infrared band name to be used for the query and must be an empty string or one of the infrared band names as defined in :command:`infrared_signature`. An empty string is equivalent to specifying "default".

   .. note::
     This performs the same function as the new method :method:`WsfPlatform.RadiantIntensity`, but only functions for infrared bands.   The new method is preferred because it is more general in that it also handles the visual band (if the optical signature is one   that also provides radiant intensity). This method may be deprecated in some future release.

.. method:: string OpticalSigState()

   Returns the current optical signature state of the platform.

.. method:: void SetOpticalSigState(string aState)

   Sets the platform's optical signature state to the given state.

.. method:: double OpticalSigScaleFactor()

   Returns the current optical signature scale factor (as a linear value, not dB).

.. method:: void SetOpticalSigScaleFactor(double aScaleValue)

   Sets the infrared optical scale factor to the given value (as an linear value, not dB). The effective optical signature of the platform becomes the baseline signature value multiplied by this value.

.. method:: double OpticalCrossSection(WsfGeoPoint aViewer, double aEarthRadiusScale)

   Returns the optical cross section of the platform (in m^2) when viewed from the location specified by *aViewer*.

   *aEarthRadiusScale* is a value that can be used to account for atmospheric refraction (typically 1.0). A value of less than or equal to zero is equivalent to specifying 1.0.

   .. note::
     This performs the same function as the new method :method:`WsfPlatform.ProjectedArea`. The new method is preferred and this method may be deprecated in some future release.

.. method:: double ProjectedArea(WsfGeoPoint aViewer, double aEarthRadiusScale)

   Returns the projected area of the platform (in m^2) when viewed from the location specified by *aViewer*.

   *aEarthRadiusScale* is a value that can be used to account for atmospheric refraction (typically 1.0). A value of less than or equal to zero is equivalent to specifying 1.0.

   .. note::
      This is equivalent to :method:`WsfPlatform.OpticalCrossSection` and is preferred because it is more representative of what is being returned.

.. method:: double RadiantIntensity(WsfGeoPoint aViewer, double aEarthRadiusScale, string aBandName)

   Returns the radiant intensity of the platform (in W/sr) when viewed from the location specified by *aViewer*.

   *aEarthRadiusScale* is a value that can be used to account for atmospheric refraction (typically 1.0). A value of less than or equal to zero is equivalent to specifying 1.0.

   *aBandName* is either "visual" or one of the infrared band names as defined in :command:`infrared_signature`. An empty string is equivalent to specifying "default". "default" should be avoid because it is possibly ambiguous.

   .. note::
      If an infrared band is supplied as *aBandName*, this is equivalent to :method:`WsfPlatform.InfraredRadiantIntensity`. This is the preferred method because it works for both visual and infrared bands.

.. method:: string RadarSigState()

   Returns the current radar signature state of the platform.

.. method:: void SetRadarSigState(string aState)

   Sets the platform's radar signature state to the given state.

   Returns the current radar signature scale factor (as a linear value, not dB).

.. method:: void SetRadarSigScaleFactor(double aScaleValue)

   Sets the radar signature scale factor to the given value (as an linear value, not dB). The effective radar signature of the platform becomes the baseline signature value multiplied by this value.

.. method:: double RadarCrossSection(double aRcvrAzimuth, double aRcvrElevation, string aPolarization, double aFrequency)
            double RadarCrossSection(WsfGeoPoint aViewer, double aEarthRadiusScale, string aPolarization, double aFrequency)
            double RadarCrossSection(double aXmtrAzimuth, double aXmtrElevation, double aRcvrAzimuth, double aRcvrElevation, string aPolarization, double aFrequency)

   Returns the radar cross section of the platform (in m^2) when viewed from the aspect (e.g. :method:`WsfPlatform.ApparentAspectOf`) specified by *aRcvrAzimuth* and *aRcvrElevation* (degrees), or location specified by *aViewer*. In the first and second versions, the transmitter and receiver are assumed to be co-located. In the third version, the aspect of the transmitter illuminating the target is specified by *aXmtrAzimuth* and *aXmtrElevation* (degrees).

   *aEarthRadiusScale* is a value that can be used to account for atmospheric refraction (typically 4/3). A value of less than or equal to zero is equivalent to specifying 4/3.

   *aPolarization* is the polarization to be used for the query and must be an empty string or one of the polarization names as defined in :command:`radar_signature`. An empty string is equivalent to specifying "default".

   *aFrequency* is the frequency of the signal (in Hertz) to be used for the query.

.. _WsfPlatform.Capabilities_Methods:

Capabilities Methods
====================

.. method:: int Capabilities()

.. method:: double Longitude()
.. method:: double Altitude()

   Returns the platform's latitude, longitude (decimal degrees) or altitude (meters above mean sea level), respectively.

   .. note::
      These commands should be used only if a single position component will be extracted. If multiple

      the returned object.

.. method:: double X()
.. method:: double Y()
.. method:: double Z()

   Returns the 'x', 'y' or 'z' component of the platform's WCS position (meters), respectively.

   .. note::
      These commands should be used only if a single position component will be extracted. If multiple
      components will be extracted, it is more efficient to use :method:`Location <WsfPlatform.Location>` and retrieve the individual components from
      the returned object.


.. method:: double Vx()
.. method:: double Vy()
.. method:: double Vz()

   Returns the 'x', 'y' or 'z' component of the platform's WCS velocity (meters/second), respectively.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint PerceivedLocation()

   :method:`Location <WsfPlatform.Location>` only if :command:`_.navigation_errors` have been defined for the platform.

.. method:: Vec3 PerceivedLocationErrorNED()
.. method:: Vec3 PerceivedLocationErrorWCS()

   Returns the difference between the perceived platform location as returned by :method:`PerceivedLocation <WsfPlatform.PerceivedLocation>` and the true platform location by :method:`Location <WsfPlatform.Location>`. The value will be non-zero only if :command:`_.navigation_errors` have been defined for the platform.

.. method:: void SetPerceivedLocationErrorWCS(Vec3 aLocationErrorWCS)

   Define the difference between the perceived platform location as returned by :method:`PerceivedLocation <WsfPlatform.PerceivedLocation>` and the true platform location returned by :method:`Location <WsfPlatform.Location>`.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint FutureLocation(double aTime)

   Returns the anticipated location of the platform at the specified time in the future. If the location cannot be determined then the return will be invalid. The return value should be tested for validity before attempting to use it.

   **Example**

   ::

     WsfGeoPoint p = FutureLocation(t);
     if (p.IsValid()) <process the data>

   This method is currently only valid for :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER`, and :model:`WSF_INTEGRATING_SPACE_MOVER`.

.. method:: void SetHeading(double aHeading)

   Sets the platform's desired Heading (body pointing angle) angle [-180, 180] (degrees).  The SetOrientationNED() command
   is similar.  Implementation differs from the TurnToHeading command below, which is actually a turn to Course command.
   Note that most Mover types do not distinguish between heading and course angles, and much infrastructure is in place
   that assumes a heading command is a desire to move in a certain direction, rather than orient in a particular
   direction.  The :model:`WSF_ROTORCRAFT_MOVER` is a notable exception to this rule, see this documentation for syntax and

   current path.

   In the two argument form, second argument is a positive linear acceleration to be used (meters/second^2) to be used to
   achieve the desired speed. It will be negated if the target speed is less than the current speed.

   By default, the mover will quit following the route and begin extrapolating on the current heading. If the
   third parameter is set to *true*, the mover will remain on the current route, but change the target speed.
