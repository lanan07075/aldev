Quaternion
----------

.. class:: Quaternion inherits Object
   :constructible:
   :cloneable:

A :class:`Quaternion` is a four-valued mathematical construct, an alternative to three Euler rotation angles or a Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) as a way to represent the orientation of a solid body in 3-D space.  It has the advantage of not producing a mathematical singularity at pitch angles of +/- 90 degrees. Euler rotation angles are performed in the following order:

* Psi   = Yaw Rotation(+Z)
* Theta = Pitch Rotation(+Y)
* Phi   = Roll Rotation(+X)

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: static Quaternion Construct(double aPsi, double aTheta, double aPhi)

   Return a new quaternion with the provided Euler rotation angles given in degrees.

.. method:: static Quaternion Construct(double aA, double aI, double aJ, double aK)

   Return a new quaternion with the provided initial values for angle and vector.

.. method:: static Quaternion Multiply(Quaternion aOrientation1, Quaternion aOrientation2)

   Returns the product of the two given quaternions.

.. method:: static Quaternion Slerp(Quaternion aOrientation1, Quaternion aOrientation2, double aInterpolationCoefficient)

   Returns the spherical linear interpolation result given two quaternions and an interpolation coefficient [0..1]. An interpolation coefficient of 0 corresponds to the aOrientation1 quaternion and an interpolation coefficient of 1 corresponds to the aOrientation2 quaternion.

Methods
=======

.. method:: void Normalize()

    Re-normalizes the quaternion.

    .. note::

       A quaternion orientation should always have a magnitude of one, so after constructing and/or extended time propagation, it should be re-normalized.

.. method:: void SetRate(Quaternion aOrientation, Vec3 aBodyRate)

   Sets a Quaternion to a Rate, from an orientation and local body rates.
   The aBodyRate vector is (X,Y,Z) body-axis rates, in degrees per second.

   .. note::

     Do not re-normalize this vector before use, as it is an incremental change value, with non-unity magnitude.

.. method:: void Set(double aPsi, double aTheta, double aPhi)

   Set the quaternion as an orientation with the given Euler angles in degrees.

.. method:: Vec3 Rotate(Vec3 aVector)

   Rotate a vector by this quaternion.  The quaternion is assumed to be normalized.

.. method:: Vec3 ReverseRotate(Vec3 aVector)

   Reverse, or de-rotate a vector by this quaternion.  The quaternion is assumed to be normalized.

.. method:: Quaternion Rotate(Vec3 aBodyRates, double aDeltaT)

   Propagate the body-relative rotation rates forward to a new orientation.
   The aBodyRate vector is (X,Y,Z) body-axis rates, in degrees per second, and aDeltaT specifies the
   amount of time over which to integrate the body rates.

   ..note:: This function degrades in accuracy at larger time steps with higher rotation rates; the context is assumed to be digital forward integration of platform motion state in small steps.

.. method:: double Psi()

   Return the psi Euler angle equivalent (in degrees) represented by this quaternion.

.. method:: double Theta()

   Return the theta Euler angle equivalent (in degrees) represented by this quaternion.

.. method:: double Phi()

   Return the phi Euler angle equivalent (in degrees) represented by this quaternion.
