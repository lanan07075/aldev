WsfEM_Rcvr
----------

.. class:: WsfEM_Rcvr inherits WsfEM_XmtrRcvr

WsfEM_Rcvr is the receiver of electromagnetic radiation associated with a :class:`WsfEM_Interaction` and defined by the :command:`_.receiver` block.

.. note::

   Use the :method:`WsfSensor.Rcvr`, :method:`WsfComm.Rcvr`, or :method:`WsfEM_Interaction.Rcvr` script methods to access the :class:`WsfEM_Rcvr`.

Methods
=======

.. method:: void Activate()

   Activates, or turns on the receiver, allowing EM interactions to occur within the simulation regarding this receiver.
   Note that this is the default state for receivers.

.. method:: void Deactivate()

   Deactivates, or turns off the receiver, preventing EM interactions from occurring within the simulation regarding this receiver.

.. method:: double BandwidthEffect(double aFrequency, double aBandwidth)

   Given a frequency(Hz) and bandwidth(Hz), returns a fraction [0..1] of the signal that is receivable for this receiver.

.. method:: bool CanInteractWith(WsfEM_Xmtr aXmtr)

   Given a transmitter, returns true if this receiver can interact (receive) from the transmitter, false if it cannot.

.. method:: double DetectionThreshold()

   Returns the minimum signal-to-noise db ratio detectable by this receiver.

.. method:: void SetDetectionThreshold(double aRatio)

   Sets the minimum signal-to-noise db ratio detectable by this receiver.

.. method:: string Function()

   Returns the function of this receiver, describing the receiver use case. The following types are possible:

   * rf_comm
   * rf_sensor
   * rf_passive_sensor
   * rf_interferer
   * rf_undefined

.. method:: double InstantaneousBandwidth()

   Returns the receiver instantaneous bandwidth (Hz).

.. method:: void SetInstantaneousBandwidth(double aBandwidth)

   Sets the receiver instantaneous bandwidth (Hz).

.. method:: double NoisePower()

   Returns the receiver noise power level (dBW).

.. method:: void SetNoisePower(double aPower)

   Sets the receiver noise power level (dBW).

.. method:: double NoiseFigure()

   Returns the receiver noise figure (db ratio) attributed to this receiver.

.. method:: void SetNoiseFigure(double aFigure)

   Sets the receiver noise figure (db ratio) for this receiver.

.. method:: double NoiseMultiplier()

   Returns the noise multiplier (db ratio) that is used in SNR calculations for this receiver.

.. method:: void SetNoiseMultiplier(double aRatio)

   Sets the noise multiplier (db ratio) for use in SNR calculations for this receiver.

.. method:: double PolarizationEffect(string aPolarization)

   Returns the ratio of the signal that would be received given a signal of the provided polarization type on this receiver.
   See :method:`WsfEM_XmtrRcvr.PolarizationTypes` for the available polarization types in AFSIM.

.. method:: void SetPolarizationEffect(string aPolarizationType, double aRatio)

   For the provided polarization type, set the fraction of the signal [0..1] that is received.
   Note that this value is set in respect to the current operating polarization type of this receiver at the time of the call.
   See :method:`WsfEM_XmtrRcvr.PolarizationTypes` for the available polarization types in AFSIM.

.. method:: double AntennaOhmicLoss()

   Returns the loss factor (dB) on this receiver attributed to the ohmic resistance of the antenna.

.. method:: void SetAntennaOhmicLoss(double aRatio)

   Sets the loss factor (dB) on this receiver attributed to the ohmic resistance of the antenna. Since this is a loss factor (inverse of gain), it should be greater than 0 dB.

.. method:: double ReceiveLineLoss()

   Returns the loss factor (dB) on this receiver attributed to the loss between the antenna and the receiver.

.. method:: void SetReceiveLineLoss(double aRatio)

   Sets the loss factor (dB) on this receiver attributed to the loss between the antenna and the receiver. Since this is a loss factor (inverse of gain), it should be greater than 0 dB.
