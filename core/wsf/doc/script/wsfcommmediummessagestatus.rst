WsfCommMediumMessageStatus
--------------------------

.. class:: WsfCommMediumMessageStatus

Description
===========

The WsfCommMediumMessageStatus script class provides access to the internal data maintained by
:command:`medium` objects during typical processing. Usage of this class allows inspection
by the user of message transmission and propagation states for higher complexity script method logic
and analysis purposes. The only mutable factor available to users using this class is to prevent
future message delivery, and all other script objects available via this object are not mutable.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfCommMessage GetMessage()

   Returns the message associated with this message status object.

.. method:: bool IsTransmitting()

   Returns true if the message associated with this object is currently being transmitted over the medium.
   Returns false if the message has finished transmitting and is currently propagating.

   .. note::

      If a message is transmitting, it is also implicitly propagating.

.. method:: double GetTimeStart()

   Returns the simulation time that this message began transmitting over the medium.

.. method:: double GetTimeTransmissionEnd()

   If a message is currently transmitting, provides the time this transmission is **expected** to end
   transmission over the medium. If the message is **not** currently transmitting, this is the exact
   time this message ended transmission over the medium.

   .. note::

      In the case that the message is currently transmitting, this time may be modified due to various
      conditions within the communication framework that are encountered during transmission.
      While usage of this time is the typical use case, it is not guaranteed.

.. method:: double GetTimeDelivery()

   Returns the simulation time this message is **expected** to be delivered over this medium.

   .. note::

      This is **always** an estimation, as the message status object is removed upon message delivery.
      Various conditions within the communications framework that are encountered during transmission and
      propagation may alter this time, or prevent the delivery of this message completely.

.. method:: bool GetDeliveryFailure()

   Returns true if this message is indicated to **NOT** be delivered. Messages that fail transmission or
   propagation for various reasons internal to the communications framework still progress through the
   typical medium processing even if indicated to not be delivered. The receiving communications object
   will not receive this message.

   Returns false if the message is processing normally, and is currently indicated to be delivered.

   .. note::

      This value may change at any point in the processing of a message over a medium. It is only valid
      at the time this method is called.

.. method:: bool SetDeliveryFailure()

   Changes the abort delivery flag for this message such that it will **NOT** be delivered. Returns true
   if this action was successful, false otherwise.

   .. note::

      This call is only applicable for messages that are currently not indicated to abort delivery. Users
      may not change a message already indicated to not be delivered to one that will be delivered.
