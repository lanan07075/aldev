WsfPlatformPart
---------------

.. class:: WsfPlatformPart inherits WsfObject

General Methods
===============

.. method:: WsfPlatform Platform()

   Returns the owning platform of the part.

.. method:: bool IsNonOperational()

   Returns true if the part is marked as non-operational. Any request to turn a non-operational part on will be rejected.

.. method:: bool IsOperational()

   Returns true if the part is marked as operational. An operational part can be turned on and off as desired.

.. method:: bool SetOperational(bool aOperational)

   Sets the operational state of the object. If the argument is true, the object will be defined to be 'operational,'
   which means it can be turned on and off as desired. If the argument is false, the object will be defined to be
   'non-operational,' which means any attempt to turn the object on will be rejected.

   The return value is true if the change was successful, or false if not.

.. method:: bool IsTurnedOff()

   Returns true if the part is turned off.

.. method:: bool IsTurnedOn()

   Returns true if the part is turned on.

.. method:: bool InitiallyTurnedOn()

   Returns true if the part is turned on when initially added to the simulation.

.. method:: double TimeSinceLastStatusChange()

   Returns the number of seconds since the part was last turned off or on.

.. method:: void SendMessage(WsfMessage aMessage)

   Sends the message to all linked objects.

.. method:: void SendMessage(WsfMessage aMessage, string aPartName)

   Sends the message to the platform part with the specified name on the current platform.

   .. note::

      This probably only makes sense for sending messages from one processor to another. In the future it
      may be possible to send messages to sensors, etc.


.. method:: bool DebugEnabled()

   Returns the value of the 'debug' attribute for the part.

.. method:: void SetDebugEnabled(bool aValue)

   Sets the "debug' attribute of the part to the indicated value. Many parts use this attribute to control the display of
   debugging output.

.. method:: double DamageFactor()

   Returns the current value of the 'damage factor' attribute for the part.  See details below on 'damage factor' attribute.

.. method:: void SetDamageFactor(double aValue)

   Sets the "damage factor' attribute of the part to the indicated value.  Each platform part may now be damaged
   separately from the platform as a whole.  Zero is no damage, One is totally destroyed, and values supplied outside this
   range are constrained to the closed interval.

.. method:: bool CategoryMemberOf(string aCategoryName)

   Returns true if the platform is a member of the specified category.

.. _WsfPlatformPart.Group_Methods:

Group Methods
=============

.. method:: bool GroupMemberOf(string aGroupName)
.. method:: bool GroupMemberOf(WsfGroup aGroupPtr)

   Returns true if the platform part is a member of the specified group.

.. method:: Array<WsfGroup> Groups()

   Returns a list of all groups this platform part is a member of.

.. method:: Array<string> GroupsByName()

   Returns a list of names of all groups this platform part is a member of.

.. method:: void GroupJoin(string aGroupName)

   Joins the given group if it exists in the simulation.

.. method:: void GroupLeave(string aGroupName)

   Leaves the given group if this platform part is a member.
