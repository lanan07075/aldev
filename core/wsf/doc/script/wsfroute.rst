WsfRoute
--------

.. class:: WsfRoute inherits WsfObject
    :constructible:
    :cloneable:
    :container:

Example:

.. parsed-literal::

  :class:`WsfWaypoint` wp = route[i];

  :class:`WsfRoute` route = WsfRoute.CopyGlobal("my_route");
  :class:`WsfWaypoint` wpt = route[0]; # Access the first waypoint
  wpt.SetSpeed(200); # Set the speed to 200 m/s
  # CAUTION: The indexing operator returns a reference to the waypoint, and
  #          may become a null reference if the route is modified
  #          using a method like Append()

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfRoute Create(string aRouteName)

   Returns a named but empty new route.

.. method:: WsfRoute CopyGlobal(string aRouteName)

   Returns a copy of a global :command:`route` defined in the input file, named aRouteName.

.. method:: WsfRoute FindGlobal(string aRouteName)

   Returns a reference to a global :command:`route` defined in the input file, named aRouteName.  The returned route may not be modified directly, use :method:`CopyGlobal()<WsfRoute.CopyGlobal>` if modification is required.
   
.. method:: Array<string> GlobalRoutes()

   Returns the names of all the global routes as an array of strings.
   
Methods
=======

.. method:: void Append(WsfWaypoint aWaypoint)
            void Append(WsfRoute aRoute)
            void Append(WsfGeoPoint aGeoPoint, double aSpeed)
            void Append(string aRouteName)

   Appends the specified data to the end of the current route.

.. method:: void Insert(int aBeforeIndex, WsfWaypoint aNewWaypoint)

   Inserts the supplied waypoint into the route before the waypoint at the specified index. aBeforeIndex must be in the range [0, :method:`Size()<WsfRoute.Size>`-1].

.. method:: void Remove(int aWaypointIndex)

   Removes a waypoint from the route.  aWaypointIndex must be in the range [0, :method:`Size()<WsfRoute.Size>`-1].

.. method:: WsfRoute Copy()

   Returns a copy of the route.

.. method:: int Size()

   Returns the number of waypoints in the route.

.. method:: WsfWaypoint Waypoint(int aIndex)
            WsfWaypoint Waypoint(string aLabel)

   Returns the waypoint at aIndex, or the waypoint with label aLabel. Waypoint(int) is equivalent to the index operator: "route[int]".

   .. note::

      This returns a **reference** to the waypoint.  Modification of the waypoint affects the route.  If waypoints are added or removed from the route, the waypoint reference may become invalidated.

.. method:: WsfWaypoint Front()

   Returns the first waypoint in the route.

   .. note::

      This returns a **reference** to the waypoint.  Modification of the waypoint affects the route.  If waypoints are added or removed from the route, the waypoint reference may become invalidated.

.. method:: WsfWaypoint Back()

   Returns the last waypoint in the route.

   .. note::

      This returns a **reference** to the waypoint.  Modification of the waypoint affects the route.  If waypoints are added or removed from the route, the waypoint reference may become invalidated.


.. method:: void Print()

   Prints the route to the console for debugging purposes.

.. method:: void SetAltitude(double aAltitude)
            void SetAltitude(double aAltitude, string aAltReference)

   Changes the altitude of all the waypoints belonging to the route.

   .. note::

      If no altitude reference is specified, the original waypoint altitude reference (e.g., agl, msl) will be used.

.. method:: double GetSpeed(int aIndex)

   Returns the speed at the specified waypoint.

.. method:: void SetSpeed(double aSpeed)

   Sets the speed value of each waypoint in the route.

.. method:: void SetSpeed(int aIndex, double aSpeed)

   Sets the speed value of the waypoint at the specified index.

.. method:: void Transform(double aLatitude, double aLongitude, double aHeading)

   Transforms the route at the given location aligned with the specified heading.  This is typically used to orient orbits in a particular direction.

.. method:: void AddCallbackToWaypoint(string aCallbackName, int aIndex)

   Adds the specified :command:`callback` to the waypoint at the specified index.

.. method:: void AddCallbackToLastWaypoint(string aCallbackName)

   Adds the specified :command:`callback` to the last waypoint in the route.

.. method:: void AddCallbackToLastWaypoint(string aCallbackName, string aProcessorName)

   Adds the specified :command:`callback` from the specified processor to the last waypoint in the route.

.. method:: void AddCallbackToLastWaypoint(Method aMethod)

   Adds the specified callback :class:`Method` to the last waypoint in the route.  The given method should take 0 or 1 argument as follows::

    void A_Method()
    void A_Method(WsfPlatform aCaller)

.. method:: double TotalLength()

   Returns total length of the route in meters.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint LocationAtDistance(double aDistance)

   Returns a :class:`WsfGeoPoint` at a location along the route at the specified distance from the start of the route.

   .. note::

      This method is accurate with routes containing Latitude/Longitude points only.

.. method:: double DistanceAlongRoute(WsfGeoPoint aLocation)

   Given a point on or near the route, this computes the approximate distance from the start of the route.

   .. note::

     This method is accurate with routes containing Latitude/Longitude points only.

.. method:: double DistanceFromRoute(WsfGeoPoint aLocation)

   Computes the distance between the given point and the closest segment on the route.

   .. note::

      This method is
      accurate with routes containing Latitude/Longitude points only.

.. method:: WsfRoute SubrouteByDistance(double aDistance1, double aDistance2)

   Computes a sub-route from this route given a starting and ending distance from the route's first point.  If aDistance1 is less than aDistance2, the resulting route will be reversed.  Both distance values should be in the range [0, :method:`TotalLength()<WsfRoute.TotalLength>`].

   Example::

    WsfRoute reversed = route.SubrouteByDistance(route.TotalLength(), 0)

   .. note::

      This method is accurate with routes containing Latitude/Longitude points only.

.. method:: Array<Object> Intersect(WsfRoute aOtherRoute)

   Computes the intersection of this route and aOtherRoute assuming straight segments.  Ignores altitude differences between the routes.  Returns an array with 3 elements for each intersection: (int segment_index_1, int segment_index_2, :class:`WsfGeoPoint` intersection_location).  The segment_indexes give the waypoint index where the intersection occurs for each route.

.. method:: Iterator WsfRouteIterator GetIterator()

   Returns an iterator that points to the beginning of the route. This is used by the script language to support the **foreach** command, but may also be used directly.
