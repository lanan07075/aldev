------

.. class:: Matrix inherits Object
   :cloneable:

:class:`Matrix` provides a real-valued matrix class.

Static Method
=============

.. method:: static Matrix Construct(int aRow, int aColumns)

   Construct a :class:`Matrix` with *aRow* rows and *aColumns* columns, with all entries in the matrix set to zero.

.. method:: static Matrix Construct(int aRow, int aColumns, double aValue)

   Construct a :class:`Matrix` with *aRow* rows and *aColumns* columns, with all entries in the matrix set to *aValue*.

.. method:: static Matrix Identity(int aSize)

   Construct an identity :class:`Matrix` with the given *aSize*.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int Rows()

   Return the number of rows of this matrix.

.. method:: int Columns()

   Return the number of columns of this matrix.

.. method:: double Get(int aRow, int aColumn)

   Return the value in row *aRow* and column *aColumn*. Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aRow* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Rows`, and the provided *aColumn* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Columns`.

.. method:: Matrix Row(int aRow)

   Return row *aRow* of this matrix. The returned matrix will be a row matrix (calling :method:`Matrix.Rows` on it will return 1). Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aRow* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Rows`.

.. method:: Matrix Column(int aColumn)

   Return column *aColumn* of this matrix. The returned matrix will be a column matrix (calling :method:`Matrix.Columns` on it will return 1). Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aColumn* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Columns`.

.. method:: Matrix Diagonal()

   Return a column matrix containing the diagonal elements of this matrix. This matrix does not need to be square, and the number of rows in the returned value will be either the value returned by `Matrix.Rows` or `Matrix.Columns` called on this matrix, whichever is smaller.

.. method:: Matrix Submatrix(int aInitialRow, int aFinalRow, int aInitialColumn, int aFinalColumn)

   Return a new matrix constructed from a submatrix of this matrix. The submatrix extends from the initial row, *aInitialRow*, inclusive to the final row, *aFinalRow*, exclusive, and from the initial column, *aInitialColumn*, inclusive to the final column, *aFinalColumn*, exclusive. Indices are zero-referenced. The size of the resulting submatrix cannot be zero in either dimension.

.. method:: double Trace()

   Return the trace of this matrix. This is only defined for square matrices.

.. method:: bool IsRow()

   Return if this matrix is a row matrix (i.e., :method:`Matrix.Rows` would return 1 for this matrix).

.. method:: bool IsColumn()

   Return if this matrix is a column matrix (i.e., :method:`Matrix.Columns` would return 1 for this matrix).

.. method:: bool IsPositiveDefinite()

   Return if this matrix is positive definite. This is only defined for square matrices.

.. method:: void Set(int aRow, int aColumn, double aValue)

   Set the value at row *aRow* and column *aColumn* to the provided *aValue*. Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aRow* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Rows`, and the provided *aColumn* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Columns`.

.. method:: void SetRow(int aRow, Matrix aRowMatrix)

   Set row *aRow* of this matrix to be equal to the provided *aRowMatrix*. Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aRow* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Rows`. The provided *aRowMatrix* must have a single row, and have a number of columns equal to this matrix.

.. method:: void SetColumn(int aColumn, Matrix aColumnMatrix)

   Set column *aColumn* of this matrix to be equal to the provided *aColumnMatrix*. Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aColumn* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Columns`. The provided *aColumnMatrix* must have a single column, and have a number of rows equal to this matrix.

.. method:: void SetDiagonal(Matrix aDiagonalValues)

   Set the diagonal values of this matrix to the provided *aDiagonalValues*. The provided *aDiagonalValues* should be in a column matrix with a number of rows equal to the lesser of :method:`Matrix.Rows` or :method:`Matrix.Columns` called on this matrix.

.. method:: void SetSubmatrix(int aRow, int aColumn, Matrix aSubMatrix)

   Set the values of this matrix starting at row *aRow* and column *aColumn* according to the given *aSubMatrix*. Indices are zero-referenced; the provided *aRow* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Rows`, and the provided *aColumn* must be non-negative and less than the value returned by :method:`Matrix.Columns`. The size of the given *aSubMatrix* must be such that it does not run past the end of this matrix.

.. method:: Matrix Multiply(Matrix aOther)

   Return the matrix resulting from multiplying this matrix by *aOther* on the right.

.. method:: Matrix Inverse()

   Return the inverse of this matrix. This is only defined for non-singular, square matrices.

.. method:: Matrix PseudoInverse()

   Return the pseudo-inverse of this matrix.

.. method:: Matrix Transpose()

   Return the transpose of this matrix.

.. method:: Matrix Add(Matrix aOther)

   Return a matrix that is the sum of this matrix and *aOther*. The provided matrix must have the same size as this matrix.

.. method:: Matrix Subtract(Matrix aOther)

   Return a matrix that is the difference of this matrix and *aOther*. The provided matrix must have the same size as this matrix.

.. method:: Matrix Scale(double aValue)

   Multiple each element of this matrix by *aValue* and return the resulting matrix.

.. method:: Matrix CholeskyDecomposition()

   Return the Cholesky decomposition of this matrix. This is only defined for positive-definite, square matrices.

.. method:: Array<Object> SingularValueDecomposition()

   Return the singular value decomposition of this matrix. The returned array contains, in order: an integer indicating which singular values were successfully computed; a column matrix containing the singular values; the :math:`U` matrix; and the :math:`V` matrix.

   If this matrix, :math:`M`, is :math:`m \times n`, then the singular value decomposition finds three matrices :math:`\Sigma`, a :math:`n \times n` matrix containing the singular values along the diagonal, :math:`U`, a :math:`m \times n` matrix, and :math:`V`, a :math:`n \times n` matrix such that :math:`M = U \Sigma V^T`.

   The first element of the returned value is an integer that is zero if the decomposition was successfully computed. In cases when this is not zero, it indicates that the singular values at indexes higher than the returned value were successfully computed.

.. method:: Array<Matrix> Eigensystem()

   Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. This is only defined for a square matrix.

   The eigenvalues are returned as a column matrix, and the eigenvectors are returned as the columns of a square matrix, with column :math:`i` being the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue at index :math:`i` of the eigenvalues. The column of eigenvalues is returned as the first element of the returned array, and the matrix of eigenvectors is returned as the second element of the returned array.
