WsfImage
--------

.. class:: WsfImage
   :cloneable:

WsfImage is typically contained with a :class:`WsfImageMessage` or :class:`WsfVideoMessage` and represents the product of an
imaging sensor.


Image Methods
=============

These methods pertain to the image as a whole.

.. method:: double ImageTime()
            double Time()

   Returns the time the image was produced.

.. method:: int ImageNumber()
            int Number()

   Returns the image number of the image within a stream of images. For an image that represents a frame in a video
   stream, this would be the frame number within the stream.

.. method:: void SetImageNumber(int aNumber)
            void SetNumber(int aNumber)

   Set the image number of the image within a stream of images.

.. method:: int StreamNumber()

   Returns the stream number of the image. For a static image, this number is incremented for
   each image. For a video stream this number is incremented whenever the sensor is turned on.

.. method:: void SetStreamNumber(int aNumber)

   Set the stream number that contains the image.

.. method:: WsfPlatform Originator()

   Returns the platform containing the originating sensor.

   .. note::

      Use with caution. The platform may have been deleted.

.. method:: int OriginatorIndex()

   Returns the platform index of the platform that contained the sensor that produced the image.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint OriginatorLocation()

   Returns the location of the platform that contained the sensor that produced the image.

.. method:: string SensorName()

   The name of the sensor that produced the image.

.. method:: string SensorType()

   The type of the sensor that produced the image.

.. method:: string SensorMode()

   The mode in which the originating sensor was operating at the time it produced the image.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint CenterLocation()

   Returns the approximate location of the center of the image.

   .. note::

      This may be zero if it is not defined by the sensor implementation.


.. method:: double Width()
            double Height()

   Returns the width and height, respectively, of the image in pixels.

   .. note::

      This may be zero if it is not defined by the sensor implementation.


.. method:: double WidthResolution()
            double HeightResolution()

   Returns the width and height of an image pixel in meters.

   .. note::

      These may be zero if it is not defined by the sensor implementation.


.. method:: double CollectionFactor()

   A value of less than 1 indicates that the collection time was not
   sufficient to achieve the desired resolution, while a value greater than 1 indicates the collection time was greater
   than that needed to achieve the desired resolution.

   The return value will be 1.0 if the sensor did not define a value.

   .. note::

      Be sure to allow some tolerance when checking this value for 1.0 as the achieved resolution may differ
      a slight amount from the requested value due to timing and other numerical issues.


.. method:: double NoiseLevel()

   Returns the noise level of the producing sensor.

   .. note::

      This may be zero if it is not defined by the sensor implementation.


.. method:: double BackgroundLevel()

   Returns the signal level of the 'background.'

   .. note::

      This may be zero if it is not defined by the sensor implementation.


.. method:: double MinimumLevel()

   Returns the signal level that corresponds to a PixelIntensity_() of zero.

.. method:: double MaximumLevel()

   Returns the signal level that corresponds to a PixelIntensity_() of one.

.. method:: int ObjectCount()

   Returns the number of objects seen in the image.

Object Methods
==============

These methods are used to obtain information about a specific object in the image.



.. note::

   Unless otherwise noted, the methods take an object index value (**aIndex**) that represents the object whose information is to be retrieved. This value must be in the range:: **0 <= aIndex < ObjectCount()**

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint Location(int aIndex)

   Returns the perceived location of the specified object in the image.

.. method:: double SignalLevel(int aIndex)

   Returns the signal level of the specified object in the image.

   .. note::

      This may be zero if it is not defined by the sensor implementation.

.. method:: double PixelCount(int aIndex)

   Returns the approximate number of pixels occupied by the specified object in the image.

.. method:: double PixelIntensity(int aIndex)

   Returns the approximate intensity of the specified object in the image. The return value is in the range [0, 1], where
   a value of zero corresponds to a signal level of returned by MinimumLevel_() and a value of one
   corresponds to a signal level returned by MaximumLevel_().

.. method:: int TruthIndex(int aIndex)

   Returns the truth platform index of the specified object in the image.

.. method:: string TruthName(int aIndex)

   Returns the truth platform name of the specified object in the image.

.. method:: string TruthType(int aIndex)

   Returns the truth type of the specified object in the image.

.. method:: string TruthSide(int aIndex)

   Returns the truth side of the specified object in the image.
