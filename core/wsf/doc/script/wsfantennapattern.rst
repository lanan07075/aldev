WsfAntennaPattern
-----------------

.. class:: WsfAntennaPattern inherits WsfObject

WsfAntennaPattern is the base script class for all antenna patterns.

Methods
=======

.. method:: double AzimuthBeamwidth(double aFrequency)
            double AzimuthBeamwidth(double aFrequency, double aAzEBS, double aElEBS)

   Returns the width of the beam in azimuth degrees for the provided frequency (Hz). The three argument version takes both *aAzEBS* and *aElEBS* combined to affect the individual azimuth beamwidth.

.. method:: double ElevationBeamwidth(double aFrequency)
            double ElevationBeamwidth(double aFrequency, double aAzEBS, double aElEBS)

   Returns the width of the beam in elevation degrees for the provided frequency (Hz). The three argument version takes both *aAzEBS* and *aElEBS* combined to affect the individual elevation beamwidth.

.. method:: double MinimumGain()

   Returns the minimum gain (dB) for this pattern.

.. method:: double PeakGain(double aFrequency)

   Returns the peak gain (dB) for this pattern at the provided frequency (Hz).

.. method:: double GainAdjustment()

   Returns the simple gain adjustment value used (dB) for this pattern when a gain adjustment table is not utilized.
