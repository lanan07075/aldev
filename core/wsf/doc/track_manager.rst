Overview
========

The track_manager_ block is a subcommand of a :command:`platform` that defines subcommands for the platform's master track
manager.  A track manager maintains the platform's master track list.
It can also be used to maintain alternate track lists with the standard WSF processor, :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`.

Commands
========

.. command:: debug

   Enable the writing of debugging information to standard output.

.. command:: correlation_method

   .. parsed-literal::

     correlation_method :ref:`<correlation-method> <correlation_methods.available_correlation_methods>`
        :ref:`Correlation commands... <correlation_methods>`
     end_correlation_method

   Specifies the correlation algorithm used by the track manager.

   A correlation (association) algorithm determines whether new information in the form of track and measurement updates is matched with existing tracks.  If so, the new information is fused with the existing tracks using the fusion_method_; otherwise, new tracks are created.

   **<correlation-method>** can be:

.. include:: correlation_types.txt

.. command:: fusion_method

   .. parsed-literal::

     fusion_method <fusion-method>
        Fusion Commands...
     end_fusion_method

   Specifies the fusion algorithms used by the track manager.

   A fusion algorithm combines information about a single entity from two or more sources into a coherent information set, or :command:`track`.

   **<fusion-method>** can be:

.. include:: fusion_types.txt

.. command:: tracker_type

 .. parsed-literal::

   tracker_type <type-name>
      :ref:`Correlation commands... <correlation_methods>`
      :ref:`Fusion commands...      <fusion_methods>`
      Other tracker commands...
   end_tracker_type

 Specifies a standard tracker type to use.  Use of this input means that one does not have to specify correlation_method_ or fusion_method_.

 .. note::
    Currently the only valid tracker_type_ is "mtt" (Multi-Target Tracker; see MTT documentation for specific tracker inputs).

.. command:: uncorrelated_track_drops [ on; off ]

   Specifies whether uncorrelated local tracks (tracks that no longer have any associated raw tracks) are to be
   dropped.  Automatically set to off if tracks are purged in an associated :model:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR`.

   **Default** on

.. command:: retain_raw_tracks

   Specifies that the track manager is to retain all raw track information.  If set, it is the responsibility of the user
   to manage raw track information.

   **Default** No raw track information is retained.

.. command:: retain_track_history

   Specifies that the track manager is to retain track history information.  If set, it is the responsibility of the user
   to manage the track history.

   **Default** No track history information is retained

.. command:: filter <type-name> end_filter

   Associates a :command:`filter` type with the track manager.  All incoming tracks of type "unfiltered sensor" will be filtered
   with this filter type.

.. command:: track ... end_track

   Defines a pre-briefed :command:`track`.

.. command:: aux_data ... end_aux_data

   Specifies additional data that will be added to any :class:`"local" track <WsfLocalTrack>` created and maintained by the track
   manager.  These will be in addition to any :command:`_.aux_data` present in the associated / correlated
   :class:`"raw" tracks <WsfTrack>`, as they are naturally merged into the local tracks.  These data are useful as additional
   aids to tracking and resource allocation.

.. command:: aux_data_fusion_rules ... end_aux_data_fusion_rules

   Defines the rules to be applied when 'fusing' :command:`_.aux_data` variables from a raw track into a local track. Normally a
   variable in a raw track will overwrite one in the local track with the same name.

   **variable <name> private**

      A variable marked "private' is one that will never be overwritten by when fusion occurs. The variable can only be
      manipulated by various local script/task processors.

   **variable <name> only_local**

       A variable marked "only_local' can only be overwritten by incoming raw tracks that originate from the this platform.

   **variable <name> prefer_local**

      A variable marked "prefer_local' can be overwritten by an incoming track from the local platform OR from an incoming
      track from another platform IF the local track does not have any other contributing track from this platform that
      contains the same variable.


.. command:: type_specific_tracker_inputs

   Various inputs will be valid, based on the  tracker_type_ selected.  Specifically, see the
   :ref:` mtt <MTT Configuration>` inputs for the MTT tracker.
