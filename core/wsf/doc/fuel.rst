# 3. Instantiate a (not previously existing) fuel object on a platform instance:

Overview
========

A fuel object defines the rate at which fuel is expended on the platform. For each :command:`platform`, total mass is
assumed to be the sum of empty mass, fuel mass, and payload mass.  Empty mass is generally a fixed quantity, payload
varies perhaps only at discrete events, but fuel quantities are consumed continuously.  The :command:`fuel` object is called
whenever the platform moves and updates the amount of fuel expended.  The resulting fuel amount is supplied back to the
platform, so that total mass is readily available for Newtonian dynamics and other such calculations.

.. note::
   If a platform does not have a :command:`fuel` object, run-time fuel computations will not be performed, but a
   fixed fuel quantity may still be supplied as :command:`platform` input.

Commands
========

.. command:: maximum_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the maximum quantity of fuel that can be carried.
   
   **Default** infinity

.. command:: initial_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the initial quantity of fuel.
   
   **Default** 0 kg

.. command:: reserve_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the threshold such that when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below this value, the platform is considered
   to be operating on reserves. If an on_reserve_ block is defined, it will be executed when this state is reached.
   
   **Default** 0 kg

.. command:: bingo_quantity <mass-value>
   
   Defines the threshold such that when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below this value, the platform is considered
   to in BINGO. If an on_bingo_ block is defined, it will be executed when this state is reached.
   
   **Default** 0 kg

.. command:: mode <mode-name>
   
   Specifies the name of the mode to be used for fuel types that support modes.

Script Interface
================

In each of the following scripts, the following variables will be predefined:

* :class:`WsfFuel`     this;              // This fuel object
* :class:`WsfPlatform` PLATFORM;          // The platform containing this fuel object
* double      TIME_NOW;          // The current simulation time

.. command:: on_bingo ... <script-definition> ... end_on_bingo
   
   Defines a script to be executed when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below the threshold defined by
   bingo_quantity_.

.. command:: on_empty ... <script-definition> ... end_on_empty
   
   Defines a script to be executed when all fuel has been expended.

.. command:: on_reserve ... <script-definition> ... end_on_reserve
   
   Defines a script to be executed when the quantity of fuel remaining falls below the threshold defined by
   reserve_quantity_.

.. command:: on_refuel ... <script-definition> ... end_on_refuel
   
   Defines a script to be executed when a refueling operation has been completed.
