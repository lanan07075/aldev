Overview
========

antenna_pattern is used in :command:`_.transmitter` and :command:`_.receiver` commands to define the gain of an antenna for communication and sensor devices.

**<pattern-name>** Specifies the name of the antenna pattern.

.. _antenna_pattern.antenna_pattern_types:

**<pattern-type-name>** Specifies one of the `Available Antenna Patterns`_:

.. include:: antenna_pattern_types.txt

Common Commands
===============

The following commands can be used in any of the antenna pattern definitions:

.. command:: minimum_gain <db-ratio-value>

   The minimum gain that will be returned.

   **Default:** -300 db

.. command:: gain_adjustment <db-ratio-value>

   An adjustment factor to be applied to the raw gain. This is especially useful if one wants to reuse a pattern that has been defined by a file (such as the :ref:`antenna_pattern.pattern_table`) and simply scale the definition.

   **Default:** 1.0 (no adjustment)

   .. note::
      This gain_adjustment_ AND gain_adjustment_table_ can be used together. The results are
      additive in logarithmic space (multiplicative in linear space).

.. command:: gain_adjustment_table  ... end_gain_adjustment_table
   :block:

   This command provides the means to define a frequency-dependent adjustment to the gain. The points define a curve on a plot whose x-axis is the log_10 of the frequency and the y-axis is adjustment factor in dB. Linear interpolation is used to derive the values for intermediate frequencies. Signals whose frequencies are outside the range of the table use the value from the appropriate endpoint (i.e., extrapolation is not performed).

   The format of the table is:

   .. parsed-literal::
    gain_adjustment_table
       frequency <frequency-value> :argtype:`\<db-ratio-1> <db-ratio-value>`
       frequency <frequency-value> :argtype:`\<db-ratio-2> <db-ratio-value>`
       ...
       frequency <frequency-value> :argtype:`\<db-ratio-n> <db-ratio-value>`
    end_gain_adjustment_table

   The following rules must be observed:

   * The entries must be in order monotonically increasing frequency.
   * There must be at least two entries, except that if no entries are provided then it is treated as though the table is not provided.

   .. note::
      This gain_adjustment_ AND gain_adjustment_table_ can be used together. The results are additive in logarithmic space (multiplicative in linear space).
