propagation_model
-----------------

.. command:: propagation_model ... end_propagation_model
    :block:

    .. parsed-literal::

       propagation_model_ *<derived-name>* *<base-name>*
          ... Input for the propagation model ...
       end_propagation_model

Overview
========

propagation_model is used to create configured *propagations models* that can be referenced in the
:command:`_.transmitter.propagation_model` block in a :command:`_.transmitter` definition.

*<derived-name>* is the name you wish your configured propagation model to be assigned. *<derived-name>* is the name by
which the user wishes to refer to the configured propagation model. *<base-name>* is one of the `Available
Propagation Models`_:

.. include:: propagation_model_types.txt

Effective Use Of Propagation Models
===================================

A propagation model definition may be embedded directly in the definition of a radar. For example, assume you have a
file called 'ex_radar.txt'::

 sensor EX_RADAR WSF_RADAR_SENSOR
    transmitter
       ... transmitter commands ...
       propagation_model fast_multipath
          ... fast_multipath model commands ...
       end_propagation_model
    end_transmitter
    receiver
       ... receiver commands ...
    end_receiver
 end_sensor

The problem with this method is that one must modify the radar definition to change or eliminate the propagation model.
In many production uses this is undesirable or infeasible. What would be more desirable is to provide a 'default'
propagation model definition that can be overridden.

The new 'ex_radar.txt' would now contain::

 # Define the 'default' propagation model
 propagation_model EX_RADAR_PROPAGATION fast_multipath
    ... fast_multipath model commands ...
 end_propagation_model

 sensor EX_RADAR WSF_RADAR_SENSOR
    transmitter
       ... transmitter commands ...
       propagation_model EX_RADAR_PROPAGATION # References the propagation model symbolically
    end_transmitter
    receiver
       ... receiver commands ...
    end_receiver
 end_sensor

Then to override the propagation model::

 #include ex_radar.txt

 # Provide a new definition that overrides the existing definition.
 # This example now uses the none propagation model.

 propagation_model EX_RADAR_PROPAGATION none
 end_propagation_model

The radar model will use the **last** definition of EX_RADAR_PROPAGATION when it finally creates instances of the radar
in the simulation.

Available Propagation Models
============================

none
^^^^

A 'dummy' propagation model that results in no effect.

 propagation_model *<derived-name>* none
 end_propagation_model

fast_multipath
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 'fast_multipath' model is an implementation of the method defined in 'Radar Range Performance Analysis, Lamont V.
Blake, 1986, Artech House, Inc.'. It computes the effects of constructive or destructive interference due to the
specular reflection of the signal off of a round, rough Earth. Two factors can be supplied to define the properties of
the surface at the reflection point.

::

 propagation_model <derived-name> fast_multipath
    soil_moisture_fraction ...
    surface_roughness ...
 end_propagation_model
   
.. command:: soil_moisture_fraction [ 0.0 .. 1.0 ]

   Define the moisture content of the soil.

   **Default** 0.15

.. command:: surface_roughness <length-value>
   
   Define the standard deviation of the variation in the height of the surface.

   **Default** 3.0 meters
