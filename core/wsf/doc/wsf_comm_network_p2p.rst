Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_NETWORK_P2P` provides a generic network that enforces a point-to-point topology. Only two comms 
may be present in this network, with bi-directional communications between them.

Commands
========

.. command:: comm_list ... end_comm_list

   Members of this network may be specified by identifying a comm object by its owning platform name and 
   the name of the comm. Each entry in this list is prefixed by the "member" command.

.. command:: address_list ... end_address_list

   Members of this network may be specified by identifying a comm object by its address. Each entry in this
   list is prefixed by the "member" command. This list is only available to comm objects that have specified
   addresses in input, as comms without specified addresses will be dynamically allocated at runtime.
