Overview
========

The **platform_type** command is used to create a platform type object that can be used as the source for the platform
command.  The **platform** command creates an object instance in the simulation and usually uses a previously defined
platform_type as its base.  Both platform_type and platform use many of the same subcommands.  However, it is
recommended to use only subcommands that apply to static definitions when using the **platform_type** command.  In
addition, creating a detailed platform without using a predefined platform base does not allow for easy reuse of the
object in the simulation.


Creating a New Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: platform <platform-name> <platform-type-name> ... end_platform

.. parsed-literal::

    platform *<platform-name>* *<platform-type-name>*
      ... *platform commands* ...
    end_platform

   Defines a platform instance in the simulation or can be used to edit a platform instance.  The *<platform-name>*
   specifies the name and must be a unique name in the simulation.  Convention is to make *<platform-name>* lowercase.
   The *<platform-type>* can either be a previously defined **platform_type** or **WSF_PLATFORM**.  **WSF_PLATFORM**
   is the only predefined platform type in WSF.

   A unique platform name can be generated by specifying **<default>** (with the brackets) as the *<platform-name>*.
   The generated name will be *<platform-type-name>:<number>*.

Creating a New Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. block:: platform

.. command:: platform_type <new-type-name> <source-type-name> ... end_platform_type

   .. parsed-literal::

    platform_type *<new-type-name>* *<source-type-name>*
      ... *platform commands* ...
    end_platform_type

   Defines a platform type that can be referenced by the platform command. The *<new-type-name>* must be unique to the
   simulation. Convention is to make *<new-type-name>* uppercase. The *<source-type-name>* can either be a
   previously defined platform type or be **WSF_PLATFORM**.  **WSF_PLATFORM** is the only *<source-type-name>*
   predefined platform type in WSF.

Editing an Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

 edit platform <platform-name> ... end_platform

 edit platform <platform-name>
   ... platform commands ...
 end_platform

This command is useful if a platform is defined in a common scenario file, but one wants to override a setting without
modifying the common scenario file. For instance, if one wants to change the route of a platform that was defined in a
common scenario file...

   This might be part of the common scenario file 'common_scenario.txt'::

    platform airliner-1 AIRLINER
       route
          ... the baseline route ...
       end_route
    end_platform

   This is how one would override the route for *airliner-1*::

    include common_scenario.txt

    edit platform airliner-1
       route
          ... a different route ...
       end_route
    end_platform

Commands
========

.. block:: platform

.. command:: side <side-name>

   Specify the 'side' ('team' or 'affiliation') to which platforms of this type belong. The side subcommand refers to
   blue, red, country or team name. Refer to the specific visualization application or tool to see what sides are supported.

   **Default** None.

.. command:: icon <icon-name>

   Specify the name of the icon to be used when platforms of this type are displayed and if the platform type does not
   have an associated :command:`dis_interface.entity_type` subcommand in the :command:`dis_interface` block.

   **Default** The value of <platform-name> or <new-type-name>.

.. command:: marking <marking-name>

   Specifies a *marking* to be applied to the platform.  This text field is associated with this platform in the
   :command:`dis_interface`.

   **Default** No marking.

.. command:: indestructible (or destructible)

   Indicates that the platform type is indestructible.  Each hit will update the cumulative probability of survival
   according to the formula:

      Ps(new) = Ps(old) * (1 - Pk)

   **Default** destructible

.. command:: on_broken [ remove | disable | disabled_but_movable ]

   Indicates what should be done when the platform is broken.

   If **remove** is specified, the platform will be removed from the simulation when it is broken.

   If **disable** is specified, the platform will remain in the simulation when it is broken. The motion of the platform
   will be halted and all of the subsystems will be set to 'nonoperational' so they cannot be turned back on. The script
   method :method:`WsfPlatform.DamageFactor` will return a value of 1.0.

   If **disabled_but_movable** is specified, the platform will remain in the simulation when it is broken. The motion of
   the platform will continue. Some movers may allow motion to be affected by the broken condition, such as slowing down
   and losing control. All of the subsystems will be set to 'nonoperational' so they cannot be turned back on.
   The script method :method:`WsfPlatform.DamageFactor` will return a value of 1.0.

   **Default** **remove**

   .. note::

      The on_damage_received_ script will be called whenever damage is received,
      even if the platform is broken. The script may be used to change the signature state, appearance, etc. It should
      be remembered however, that all subsystems will be disabled, so the platform will probably not be able to perform
      any meaningful action after it is has been broken.

.. command:: spatial_domain [ land | air | subsurface | surface | space]

   Indicates the primary spatial domain in which the platform operates. This is sometimes used to classify if an object is
   a 'land' object, 'space' object, etc.

   **Default** If the platform has a mover then the default will be inferred from the type of the mover (e.g., for
   :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER` it will be 'air'). If the platform does not have a mover then a default of 'land' will be assumed.
   land, air, surface, subsurface, space

.. command:: acoustic_signature <string-reference>

   Specifies the acoustic signature definition for this platform type.  The signature type must have been defined with
   :command:`acoustic_signature`.

   **Default** None.

.. command:: infrared_signature <string-reference>

   Specifies the infrared signature definition for this platform type.  The signature type must be previously defined with
   :command:`infrared_signature`.

   **Default** None.

   .. note::
      If **infrared_signature** is not specified and a sensing event occurs that requires it, a default of
      1000 w/sr will be assumed.


.. command:: inherent_contrast <string-reference>

   **Default** None.

.. command:: optical_reflectivity <string-reference>

   Specifies the optical reflectivity definition for this platform type. The signature type must have been defined with
   :command:`optical_reflectivity`.

   **Default** None.

   .. note::
      If **optical_reflectivity** is not specified and a sensing event occurs that requires it, a default of
      1.0 will be assumed.


.. command:: optical_signature <string-reference>

   Specifies the optical signature definition for this platform type.  The signature type must have been defined with
   :command:`optical_signature`.

   **Default** None.

   .. note::
      If **optical_signature** is not specified, but length_, width_ and height_ are
      specified, those values will be used to compute the optical cross section when needed.

   .. note::
      If **optical_signature** is not specified and **length**, **width** and **height** are not specified,
      a default of 1000 m^ will be assumed.


.. command:: radar_signature <string-reference>

   Specifies the radar signature definition for this platform type.  The signature type must have been defined with
   :command:`radar_signature`.

   **Default** None.

   .. note::
      If **radar_signature** is not specified and a sensing event occurs that requires it, a default of 1000
      m^2 will be assumed.

.. command:: geo_point <geo-point-name> <latitude-value> <longitude-value> <length-value>

   Defines a named location with a latitude, longitude, altitude tuple.  The location can be accessed using the :method:`WsfPlatform.GeoPoint` script method.

.. command:: position <latitude-value> <longitude-value>

   Specifies the latitude and longitude of the platform.  This command is only for static platforms without movers.

   **Default** 0n 0e

.. command:: nutation_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the time interval between updates to nutation calculations that are used in WCS-ECI coordinate conversions.
   
   **Default** 1000 s

.. command:: precession_nutation_update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies the time interval between updates to nutation calculations that are used in WCS-ECI coordinate conversions.
   
   **Default** 1000 s

.. deprecated:: 2.9
   This command will be replaced by nutation_update_interval_.

.. command:: mgrs_coordinate <MGRS-value>

   Specifies the coordinates of the platform in the Military Grid Reference System. This command is only for static
   platforms without movers.

.. command:: altitude <length-value> [ agl | msl ]

   Specifies the altitude of the platform.  This command is only for static platforms without movers. It is ignored if a
   mover is defined in the platform.

   **Default** 0 m msl

.. command:: creation_time <random-time-reference>

   Specifies the simulation time at which the platform is to be added to the simulation. The platform exists in memory but
   is not yet a player in the simulation.

   **Default** 0 sec (created at the start of the simulation).

.. command:: heading <angle-value>

   Specifies the orientation of the platform.  This command is only for static platforms without movers.  It is ignored if
   a mover is defined in the platform.

   **Default** 0 deg

.. command:: empty_mass <mass-reference>

   Specifies the empty mass of the platform, which is usually a fixed quantity.

   **Default** 0 kg

   .. note::
      Some movers provide a different mechanism for providing this
      value.


.. command:: fuel_mass <mass-reference>

   Specifies the fuel mass of the platform.  When specified by a user in an input file, the value is assumed to be a fixed
   quantity.  However, if the platform contains a :command:`fuel` object, it is permitted and even expected to modify the fuel
   mass during run time, overwriting what was specified with this keyword.

   **Default** 0 kg

   .. note::
      Some movers provide a different mechanism for providing this
      value.


.. command:: payload_mass <mass-reference>

   Specifies the payload mass of the platform.  When specified by a user in an input file, the value is assumed to be a
   fixed quantity.  However, certain run-time events (e.g., dropping buoys) may change the payload
   mass.

   **Default** 0 kg

   .. note::
      Some movers provide a different mechanism for providing this
      value.


.. command:: concealment_factor <concealment-factor>

   Used to denote how well a platform is VISUALLY concealed.  A value of 0.0 means there is no attempt to hide.  A factor
   of 1.0 means that it is hidden in such a way as to be undetectable (such as in a building or in an underground bunker).
   Values between the endpoints represent increasing amounts of camouflage.  Most sensors will not detect platforms with a
   concealment factor of 1.0, but any lesser value has no effect.

   **Default** 0.0

.. command:: initial_damage_factor <initial_damage_factor>

   The damage factor is a value in the range [0 .. 1] and is used to
   indicate the amount of damage to the platform.  A value of 0
   indicates no damage while a value of 1 indicates the platform is 'broken.'

   **Default** 0.0

.. command:: track_manager track_manager#Commands track-manager-commands ... end_track_manager

   Commands within this block are processed by the platform's master track manager.  See :command:`track_manager`.

.. command:: aux_data <aux-data> ...  end_aux_data

   Defines auxiliary data for a platform.  See :command:`_.aux_data`.

.. command:: height <length-reference>
.. command:: length <length-reference>
.. command:: width <length-reference>

   Specifies the dimensions of the platform.

   **Default** 0 for all values

   .. note::
      If all of these have non-zero values and optical_signature_ was not specified, these values will
      be used to compute the optical cross section when needed.


.. command:: category <category-name>

   Specifies that the platform is a member of the category specified.  Categories can be used to force sensors to
   :command:`sensor.ignore` the platform.  Categories are also accessible through the :method:`WsfPlatform.CategoryMemberOf`
   script method.

   **Default** The platform is not a member of any categories.

.. command:: clear_categories

   Has the effect of canceling any previous category_ command.

.. command:: group_join <group-name>
.. command:: group_leave <group-name>

   Adds or removes the platform from the specified :class:`group <WsfGroup>`.

.. command:: commander <commander-name>
.. command:: command_chain <command-chain-name> <commander-name>

   **commander** specifies the platform's immediate superior (commander) in the default chain of command.

   **command_chain** specifies the platform's immediate superior (commander) in the given chain of command.

   A chain of command is used by decision making routines to determine the recipients of orders and/or reports.

   .. note:: See :doc:`command_chains` for more information and examples.

   <command-chain-name>
      The name of the command chain of to which this command applies.  (The default command chain is
      implied for commander).
   <commander-name> | SELF
      The name of the platform that is the immediate superior (commander) of this platform.

   **Default** commander SELF

.. command:: route route-commands ... end_route

   The :command:`route` subcommand provides a collection of waypoints that define a path, or route, for platform movers.

.. command:: add_mover <mover-type> mover-commands ... end_mover

.. command:: mover <mover-type> mover-commands ... end_mover

   A :command:`mover` defines the domain in which a platform can move and how it moves within the domain.

   * The **add mover** command is only required inside of the **platform** command (i.e., not inside of the
     **platform_type** command).

.. command:: fuel <fuel-type> fuel-commands .. end_fuel

   A :command:`fuel object <fuel>` can be attached to a platform to model the effects of fuel consumption.

   **Default** No fuel object is defined (fuel consumption is not modeled).

   .. note::
      Some movers model fuel consumption internally.

.. _platform.component:

**<component> <component-name> [<component-type>] component-commands ... end_<component>**

.. command:: add <component> <component-name> <component-type>  component-commands ... end_<component>
.. command:: edit <component> <component-name> component-commands ... end_<component>
.. command:: delete <component> <component-name>

   Adds a component to the platform, modifies or removes an existing component.

   * The **add <component>** command adds a new component to the platform/platform_type.
   * The **edit <component>** command modifies an existing component on the platform/platform_type.
   * The **delete <component>** command removes an existing component on the platform/platform_type.
   * The **<component>** command is an abbreviated version, which adds a component if used inside a **platform_type** and modifies
     an existing component when used inside a **platform**.
   * A valid **<component>** includes :command:`comm`, :command:`fuel`, :command:`mover`, :command:`processor`, :command:`sensor`, etc.

   .. note::
      When using edit or delete commands with a fuel or mover, you do not specify the <component-name>.

   .. note::
      Zones can be removed with the delete command but can't be modified via the add or edit commands.

.. command:: track ... end_track

   Defines a pre-briefed :command:`track`.

.. command:: use_zone <shared-zone-type> as <zone-name>

   Attach a copy of the specified zone to the platform under the name <zone-name>.
   If the specified zone does not define a pose, the copied zone uses the current pose of the platform.
   This command can be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: zone  ... end_zone
.. command:: zone_set  ... end_zone_set

   The :command:`zone` and :command:`zone_set` subcommands define:

   * Relative zones which align with the platform pose.
   * Relative zones which maintain a static pose.
   * Absolute zones which maintain a static pose.

   .. seealso:: :command:`zone` and :command:`zone_set` for subcommands to affect simulated behavior.

.. command:: navigation_errors  ... end_navigation_errors

   The :command:`_.navigation_errors` block provides a method to define error in where the platform thinks it is located versus
   where it is really located. Please see :command:`_.navigation_errors` for a description of the inputs.

   **Default** No navigation errors.



Script Interface
================

:command:`platform` uses the capabilities of the :ref:`Common_Script_Interface` and implements the following additional commands:

.. command:: on_damage_received

   ::

      script void on_damage_received() ... end_script

   An optional script that can be defined which will receive control whenever there is damage to the platform.

   This script is generally used with the indestructible_ or on_broken_ command. Normally, when a platform takes damage,
   the platform is removed from the simulation if it is determined that this damage caused the platform to break. If
   **indestructible**, **on_broken disable**, or **on_broken disabled_but_movable** are specified, the platform will
   not be deleted, but instead the damage factor (DamageFactor) will be incremented and this script will be called.
   The script can do things like stop movement, turn off sensors, change appearance, etc.

   .. note::
      If **on_broken disable** was specified, the platform motion will be halted and all subsystems will be
      set to nonoperational without any additional intervention.
      If **on_broken disabled_but_movable** was specified, the platform motion will continue, but and all
      subsystems will be set to nonoperational without any additional intervention.

.. command:: on_platform_deleted

   ::

      script void on_platform_deleted() ... end_script

   An optional script that can be defined which will receive control just before the platform is removed from the
   simulation.

.. command:: on_commander_deleted
.. command:: on_peer_deleted
.. command:: on_subordinate_deleted

   .. parsed-literal::

      script void on_commander_deleted(:class:`WsfPlatform` aCommander) ... end_script
      script void on_peer_deleted(:class:`WsfPlatform` aPeer) ... end_script
      script void on_subordinate_deleted(:class:`WsfPlatform` aSubordinate) ... end_script

   Optional scripts that can be defined which will be executed just before other platforms within the platform's command_chain_ hierarchy are removed from the simulation. The single argument to each script is a reference to the platform pending removal.

.. command:: callback <callback-name> <callback-type> callback-commands end_callback

   A :command:`platform.callback` is a named action that can be called via the :command:`route.execute` command of a :command:`route` when the
   platform reaches a particular waypoint within the route.

   .. note::
      This is an obsolete form that has been replaced by scripts.
