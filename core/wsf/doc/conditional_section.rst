   end_conditional_section

Defines a block which is conditionally processed by WSF.  This construct allows inclusion or exclusion of simulation
inputs based on present features or the wsf version.  After the 'conditionals' block, any top-level WSF command may
be processed.  conditional_section blocks may be nested.

.. command:: conditionals <conditionals-commands> ... end_conditionals
   :block:

   Condition testing commands present in this block determine the inclusion of the commands that follow this block.

Conditionals Commands
=====================

.. command:: feature_present <feature-name>
   
   Tests that a feature is present.  If the feature is not present, the contents of the conditional section is ignored.

.. command:: feature_not_present <feature-name>
   
   Tests that a feature is **not** present.  If the feature **is** present, the contents of the conditional section is
   ignored.

.. command:: wsf_version <operator> <wsf-version>
   
   Compares the WSF version to a version string delimited by periods.  If the comparison fails, the conditional section
   is ignored

   operator: One of: <, <=, >, >=, =

   wsf-version: Version to compare against.  Should be in the form 1.2.3

   ::

     # Test that the wsf_version is greater than 1.0.0
     wsf_version > 1.0.0

.. command:: type_present <type-name>
.. command:: type_not_present <type-name>
   
   Determines if a 'type' is present.  If any sensor, processor, comm, mover, fuel,
   filter, service or script type exists with the given name, the type is considered present.  If the type is not present,
   the conditional section is ignored.

Features
^^^^^^^^

WSF will define a number of features available depending on build type and the optional modules available in the
executable.  The following is base list of possible features, that may not be all inclusive:
 
 * os:windows
 * os:linux
 * addr:64-bit
 * addr:32-bit
 * os:apple
 * cpu:intel
 * build:debug
 * build:release
 * build:unknown
