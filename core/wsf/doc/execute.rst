Overview
========

execute is used to define a script that is to be executed either once at a specified time or repeatedly at a
specified interval. The command may occur in the simulation context (i.e., not inside a platform) or may occur in the
context of a platform or platform part.

The first form of the command, i.e. ***at_time***, causes the enclosed script to be executed once. If a time reference
of **absolute** is specified, the script will be executed at the specified simulation time. If the time is in the past
then the script will execute immediately. If a time reference of **relative** is specified, the script will be executed
at the specified time relative to the time when the platform was created (this option is not valid if the command occurs
within the global simulation context).

The second form of the command, i.e. ***at_interval***, causes the enclosed script to be executed at the specified time
interval. In order to distribute the workload more evenly, the first execution will occur at a random time within the
defined interval. Subsequent iterations will occur at the specified interval.

If the command occurs within the context of a platform, the script variable PLATFORM will refer to the platform. In
addition, if the command occurs within the context of a processor, the script variable PROCESSOR will refer to the
processor.

Example
=======

The following will cause a sensor to be turned on and off at a specified time.

.. parsed-literal::

 platform radar-site-1 RADAR_SITE
    sensor radar ... end_sensor
    execute at_time 10 minutes absolute
       PLATFORM.TurnSensorOn("radar");
    end_execute
    execute at_time 20 minutes absolute
       PLATFORM.TurnSensorOff("radar");
    end_execute
  end_platform
