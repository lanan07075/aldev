Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_OSPF` provides an generic mission level routing
capability similar to that provided by the OSPF protocol. This protocol supports
the assignment of routers to "areas" in which detailed routing information is kept,
while only carrying a summarized level of detail of potential recipient data in
other areas. 

This protocol works by generally sending periodic multicast messages that are received
by other members of this protocol. This is used to dynamically detect new members, 
and detect the loss of other members. Data is distributed within areas, and also
carried to others externally in this format. This messaging procedure is abstracted
in its implementation.

When routing messages, if the recipient is in the local area, the message is
directly routed to that member using a graph of area network state. If the
recipient is known, but external to the area, this protocol always attempts to
send the message to a defined "backbone" area. The backbone carries messages to
any area, and all areas MUST be connected to the backbone.

Area connections are handled by defining certain comms as "border
routers". The user must specify these routers by providing multiple area
definitions as part of the protocol input.

Only one backbone can exist per connected OSPF autonomous system (AS). All areas
must connect to this area.

For destinations of messages external to OSPF enabled routers, one or more
routers sharing a connection with the desired external interfaces must have
an alternative routing protocol available to correctly handle external routing
of those messages. As such, any OSPF enabled router with any non-OSPF routing
protocol is specified as an ASBR (autonomous system border router) 
that can send messages external to the OSPF AS. Messages destined external
to OSPF use the optimal external path from an ASBR to select the
best ASBR for usage, and then route internally to that ASBR using standard OSPF
routing strategies.

Not all network topologies are compatible with OSPF. All members in an area must
be connected. Loss of border routers will cause a loss of transmission
capabilities, as is expected with this protocol. In addition, although connections
may exist externally to the OSPF provided definition, this protocol will NOT use
those connections to "route around" any missing border routers, as is intended.

Finally, OSPF typically uses a metric based on transmission capability of multiple
interfaces available for sending messages when making routing decisions. This metric
is defined by the transmission rate of any given route divided by 100 Mbps, with
a minimum value of 1.0. The only metric value less than a 1.0 is instantaneous transmission
rates, which use a metric value of 0.0 in determining the cost.

.. note:: This protocol is provided in a beta state. Bugs or other issues may exist in this version.

.. note:: This protocol is extremely taxing on simulation performance. It is highly suggested to increase the hello_interval time to the highest acceptable value to avoid the numerous multicast messages being sent at each interval, and avoiding assigning large number of comms to any specific area.

Commands
========

.. command:: ospf_area <address>

   Defines the area this comm/router belongs to in the OSPF AS. Multiple areas
   may be assigned if this member has a direct connection to another member
   in that area, defining this member as a "border router".

.. command:: remove_ospf_area <address>

   Removes an area defined for this protocol. Specifically provided for editing
   derived objects in input.

.. command:: backbone <address>

   Defines the specified area as a backbone. This only has to be done on a protocol instance
   for this setting to be applied across an entire OSPF connected AS.
   
   Only one backbone may be defined per connected OSPF AS. All other areas must
   connect to this area via border routers.
   
.. command:: remove_backbone

   This command removes the backbone specification for this protocol type or instance.
   Used in cases where a protocol type is inherited from, but the specified backbone
   setting is not wanted.
   
.. command:: ospf_dr_priority <integer-value>

   Sets the priority for this router becoming the "designated router" or 
   "backup designated router" (DR, BDR) for its network within an area. These
   routers hold all of the detailed routing data for a specific area as
   common points of communication for all other routers in the same network.
   This value must be positive, where a lower value indicates a higher priority.
   This value also affects subsequent re-selection of these routers dynamically
   at runtime. Any router entering a network and area does not preempt any
   already established DR or BDR, even if it has a higher priority.
   
   **Default** Maximum integer value
   
.. command:: hello_interval <random-time-reference>

   Defines the amount of time between sending the OSPF heartbeat, the "hello"
   packet. If these are not received before the defined hold time, the
   router will be considered non-connected or non-functional and removed from
   network state data for routing purposes. In addition, this defines how soon
   a new member is detected, as this is also the method in which new members are
   detected.
   
   A small value is added to this value to ensure these times are not exactly the
   same across the simulation, and ensure repeatability when this value is constant.
   
   **Default** constant 10 s
   
.. command:: hold_timer <random-time-reference>

   Defines the amount of time that before a member is dropped if a hello packet
   is not received. Note that the default value allows multiple hello packet 
   transmission windows before actually being dropped due to hold time. Ensure
   that this value is greater than the hello_interval to avoid dropping all
   members from network state knowledge.
   
   A small value is added to this value to ensure these times are not exactly the
   same across the simulation, and ensure repeatability when this value is constant.
   
   **Default** constant 40 s
