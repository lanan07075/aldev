Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_RIPv2` is a routing protocol based on the Bellman-Ford
algorithm, used by comm object routers to determine when updates are provided to 
other routers, as well as determining the routing path for a message sent through 
the AFSIM Communication framework. RIPv2 is designed for use with networks with a
diameter no more than 15.

As with all routing protocols, use of this object is pertinent only to perceived/dynamic routing.

.. note:: This protocol is provided in a beta state. Bugs or other issues may exist in this version.

Commands
========

.. command:: update_interval <time-value>

   Specifies how often a router will send an update to other routers. As specified for the
   RIPv2 spec (RFC 2543), this is base time. Each time an update is scheduled, the time can
   change by +/- 5 seconds.

   Default: 30 seconds

.. command:: invalidation_timeout <time-value>

   The amount of time that must pass before a route is marked as inactive. Once a router has not
   been heard from for this amount of time, routes learned from that router are marked as inactive.

   Default: 180 seconds

.. command:: garbage_collection_timeout <time-value>

   The amount of time that once a route has been marked as inactive, it will be purged from the routing
   table.

   Default: 120 seconds

.. command:: poisoned_reverse <boolean-value>

   Specifies whether to use split horizon, or split horizon with poisoned reverse. Split horizon is a
   scheme for avoiding sending routes in updates to routers from which they were learned. Poisoned
   reverse includes such routes in updates, but sets their metrics to be unusable.

   Default: on
