WSF Grammar Format
------------------

Overview
========

The WSF grammar format defines the syntax of WSF commands.  The grammar is used in the WSF IDE for parsing WSF
files.  Grammar files already exist for many WSF modules and can be found in .ag files in 'grammar' subdirectories of
SVN project directories.

::

   WSF/grammar/WSF_core.ag
   WSF_nx/grammar/WSF_nx.ag
   ...
 
It is the developer's responsibility when adding new types and commands to maintain the grammar files so that tools
like the IDE can correctly process WSF files.

Grammar File Definition
=======================

The grammar file has two main features: **Rules** to parse the WSF input and **Actions** to create data representing
the input file.

Rules
*****

Sequences
^^^^^^^^^

The most basic rule is a sequence.  Sequences are indicated by the '{' '}' symbols.  Sequences define a list of
sub-rules which each must be matched in succession.

::

   { *rule0 rule1* ... }

Within a sequence, rules are counted starting at 0.  Later, rules may be referenced using the '$0' notation.

Literals
^^^^^^^^

Literals match a single specific string of characters.  Literals can either be quoted strings or plain text.

::

   end_time
   "end_time"
  
Rule References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rules may be referenced after they are defined using the '<rule-name>' format.

::

   <my-rule>
 
Recurrences
^^^^^^^^^^^

Recurrences are rule references that recur 0 to many or 0 to 1 times.  The '*' character is used to denote a zero to
many recurrence.  '+' for 1 to many.  '?' for 0 to 1.

::

   {
     string_list <string>* end_string_list
   | A B C D {E F G}?
   }
 
Built-in Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<string>
   Matches a whitespace delimited character string

::

   MY_PLATFORM
   
<quotable-string>
   Matches either a whitespace delimited string or a quoted string

::

   MY_PLATFORM
   "C:\Program Files\MyPath"

<string-except>
   Matches any string with a list of exceptions

::

   # match any string except invalid_word1 and invalid_word2
   (string-except invalid_word1 invalid_word2)
 
<integer>
   Matches an integer
   
::

   -123
 
<real>
   Matches a real number
   
::

   -2
   -2.0
   -2.0e-7
 
(error {})
   Defines a sequence which when matched triggers an error
   
::

   #This matches any string.  If it is an integer, an error will be logged.
   {  (error { <integer> })
    | <string>
   }
 
(delimited ...)
   Defines a non-space delimited word.  All rules are matched assuming whitespace delimited inputs. 
   This provides a way to bypass this limitation.  Each argument is matched without spaces.  There are some limitations
   using this rule, most notably, every other argument must be a literal.
   
::

   # this will match latitude values like 10.5n and 60s
   {
    (delimited <real> n)
   | (delimited <real> s)
   }
 
(new *storage-address* *load-address* [&#58;option...])
   Defines a rule which attempts to create a new symbol.  The symbol at *load-address* is copied into *storage-address*.
   The addresses must be either (subtype ...) or (type ...).

(new_replace ...)
   Same as (new ...), but will replace any existing symbol.

(load *load-address*)
   Loads an existing symbol from the symbol table.

(delete *address*)
   Deletes an existing symbol.

::

   # Make a new sub-symbol on the current symbol named 'mover', loaded from 'moverType.WSF_AIR_MOVER'
   (new (subtype mover) (type moverType WSF_AIR_MOVER))
   
If there exists no symbol at load-address, the rule normally fails to match.  However, if the :backup option is
present, another load-address may be attempted.  This allows an the WSF parser to partially process types that are
unknown.

::

   # Try to load a user-defined mover.  If the user-defined type isn't found, make a WSF_AIR_MOVER.  (Logs an error)
   (new (subtype mover) (type moverType $1) :backup (type moverType WSF_AIR_MOVER))
   # Load 'mover' as the new current symbol
   (load (subtype mover)
 
Named Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^

A new named rule is created using this syntax::

   (rule *rule-name* { *rules* })
 
Examples::

   # Define a new rule
   (rule my-rule {
      end_time <Time>
   })
   # Use the new rule
   (rule my-rule-2 {
      <my-rule>
    | not <my-rule>
   })
   
Struct
^^^^^^

A struct is special type of named rule which represents an object WSF understands.  Platform, Sensor, and Processor
are examples of structs.  A struct may contain rule definitions just as the (rule ..) command, but also may contain
variables.

Example::

   (struct MY_SENSOR :base_type Sensor
                     :symbol (type sensorType MY_SENSOR)
      (var String my_setting)
   {
      my_command <String>       [my_setting=$1]
    | <Sensor>
   })
 
(symbol ...)
   specifies that the struct should be inserted in the symbol table used when parsing.  Symbols are used by the *new* and
   *load* rules.
   
(type ...)
   Specifies a position in the symbol table.  Any number of arguments are allowed.
   
::

   # This is the location of WSF_RADAR_SENSOR in the symbol table)
   (type sensorType WSF_RADAR_SENSOR)
   
(subtype ...)
   Specifies a position in the symbol table relative to the current symbol.
   
::

   # This is the location of my-sensor in the sensor list of the platform currently being parsed.
   (subtype sensors my-sensor)
   
(var *type* *name*)
   Defines an attribute belonging to the struct.  These variables are used to represent the state of  WSF objects after
   processing the input file.

Variables may have default values.

::

   (var Real earthRadiusMultiplier :default 1.0)
 
Actions
^^^^^^^

Actions may be placed before or after entries in a sequence rule.  Actions provide a mechanism to store data in
structs.  Actions are placed between '[' ']' characters.  More than one action may be specified by using the ';'
character.

::

   [my_setting1="ok";my_setting2=$1]
   
There are multiple types of actions:

Assignment
   Assigns a new value to an attribute.  **attribute=value**
   
::

   side=blue
   icon="F-18"
   width="24 inches"
   height=$1
 
Value can either be a literal value, or a reference to a value input by the user.  The input '$0' takes the result of
the user's input from the first rule in this sequence::

   { side <string>   [side=$1]
   | set width <Length>  [width=$2]
   }
   
As a shortcut, the attribute name may be used in the rule reference to denote an automatic assignment. This is equivalent::

   { side <$side>
   | set width <$width>
   }
   
push(*attribute-name*)
   Updates the current value to the specified attribute.  Actions in the proxy operate on the current object, so this will
   affect how subsequent actions or sub-rules are processed until after the next subrule is complete:

This sets the 'auxData' attribute as the current object to later be modified by commands in the 'AuxData.block' rule.

::

   {
    [push(auxData)] <AuxData.block>
   }
   
new(*attribute-name*,*key-name*)
   Adds a new entry to an 'ObjectMap' attribute and sets the current object to the new value.
   
This adds a new entry to the category.

::

   # Map the command chain name to the commander name
   (var ObjectMap/String commandChains)
   {
      # When this rule is matched, add a new command chain entry with the first user input
      # Then assign the value to the second user input.
      command_chain <string> <string> [new(commandChains,$1);this=$2]
   }
 
apply($$)
   Applies previous (new ...) or (load ...) rule to the proxy data structures. Normally (new ...) and (load ...) operate
   only on the symbol table and have no effect on struct attributes.  This command effectively does the same action to the
   proxy structure as the symbol table.
